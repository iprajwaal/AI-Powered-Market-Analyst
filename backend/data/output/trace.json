This article will provide a comprehensive overview of these developments, offering insights into the future direction of the beauty industry in an AI-driven world.\n2. AI in the Beauty Industry\nOverview of AI Technologies and current Applications\nAI\u2019s influence in the beauty industry is already visible \nthrough a variety of innovative products and services that are transforming how consumers interact with beauty brands.\nPersonalized Skincare and Makeup: Brands like L\u2019Or\u00e9al and \nEst\u00e9e Lauder are leading the way in AI-driven personalization. For example, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Modiface platform uses AI to analyze users\u2019 skin and provide personalized skincare routines and product recommendations. This personalized approach not only enhances the customer experience but also increases brand loyalty by catering to individual needs.\nVirtual Try-On Technologies: Sephora and MAC Cosmetics \nare among the companies that have embraced AI-powered virtual try-on tools. These tools use computer vision and augmented reality (AR) to allow consumers to experiment with different makeup products virtually. This technology has been particularly successful in enhancing online shopping experiences, as it reduces the uncertainty of purchasing beauty products without trying them first.\nAI-Driven Skin Diagnostics: Companies like Olay and \nThe growing adoption of AI in beauty reflects a broader trend \ntowards personalization and consumer engagement. As more brands integrate AI into their operations, the beauty industry is likely to see continued growth and innovation, making AI a critical component of the industry\u2019s future.\n3. Personalization in Cosmetics\nThe Shift Towards Personalization\nFor decades, the beauty industry was dominated by a so too did their demand for products that catered specifically to their individual needs. The rise of social media and digital platforms has played a significant role in this shift. Consumers are now more informed, have access to a wealth of beauty knowledge, and are more vocal about their desire for products that align with their unique identities. This demand for customization has driven innovation in the beauty industry, pushing brands to move beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all model.\nThe trend towards personalization is also reflective of broader \nsocietal shifts towards inclusivity and diversity. Consumers are no longer content with being treated as part of a homogeneous group; they expect brands to acknowledge and cater to their individual needs, whether that means providing a foundation that matches their exact skin tone or a skincare routine tailored to their specific concerns. This shift has forced beauty brands to rethink their product development and marketing strategies, leading to the creation of more personalized and inclusive product lines.\nAI\u2019s Role in Personalization\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool \nin the drive towards personalization in the beauty industry. AI \nenables brands to analyze vast amounts of data to understand individual consumer preferences, behaviors, and needs. This data-driven approach allows companies to create highly customized beauty products and experiences that were previously unimaginable.\nOne of the key ways AI enables personalization is through \nmachine learning algorithms. These algorithms can process and analyze data from millions of consumers, identifying \npatterns and preferences that help brands tailor their offerings to \nindividual needs. For example, AI can analyze skin types, tones, and conditions to recommend specific skincare products that are \nmost likely to be effective for a particular consumer. This level \nof personalization ensures that consumers receive products that \nare truly suited to their unique beauty needs, rather than relying \non generalized products that may or may not work for them.\nVirtual try-on tools powered by AI and augmented reality \n(AR) are another example of how technology is driving \npersonalization in cosmetics. Brands like Sephora and L\u2019Or\u00e9al \nhave developed virtual try-on applications that allow consumers \nto see how different makeup products will look on their faces \nbefore making a purchase. These tools use advanced facial recognition technology to map the user\u2019s face and simulate \nthe application of various products, providing a personalized \n\n4. Challenges\nTechnical Challenges\nThe development of AI-driven personalized cosmetics is not technologies with existing systems and platforms used by beauty brands. This involves ensuring that AI tools can seamlessly work with current databases, e-commerce platforms, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Additionally, \nthe real-time processing of data required for virtual try-ons \nand personalized recommendations demands significant \ncomputational resources, which can be costly and complex to \nimplement.\nThe reliability of AI predictions also poses a challenge. \nWhile AI can make informed guesses based on past data, beauty is highly subjective, and personal preferences can vary widely. \nAI systems must be continually updated and refined to keep pace \nwith changing trends and consumer expectations, which requires \nongoing investment in research and development.\nPotential Social and Cultural Impacts\nAI-driven beauty innovations also raise important social and \ncultural concerns. One major issue is the potential for reinforcing \nbeauty stereotypes. If AI systems are trained on biased data that reflects narrow beauty standards, they may perpetuate these standards by recommending products that align with these biases. This can limit the diversity of beauty representations and reinforce harmful societal norms.\nMoreover, there are concerns about data privacy and the \nethical use of consumer information. AI systems that collect and analyze personal data, such as skin type, facial features, and even genetic information, must do so in a way that respects user privacy and complies with data protection regulations. Misuse of this data could lead to breaches of trust and have significant legal and ethical ramifications for beauty brands.\nThe digital divide is another potential issue, where consumers \nwho lack access to the latest technology may be excluded from the benefits of AI-driven personalization. This could exacerbate existing inequalities and create a more segmented market where only those with access to advanced technology can enjoy personalized beauty experiences.\n5. Future Directions\nInnovations on the Horizon\nAs AI continues to evolve, several emerging trends and \ntechnologies have the potential to further revolutionize the \nbeauty industry. One such innovation is the use of generative AI, which can create entirely new product formulations based on individual consumer data. This technology could enable brands to offer hyper-personalized products that are custom-made for each consumer, rather than simply recommending existing products.\nAI-powered diagnostic tools are also expected to become \n\n6. Conclusion\nSummary\nThis article has explored the transformative impact of AI \non the beauty industry, particularly in the area of personalized cosmetics. We have discussed how AI technologies like machine learning, computer vision, and predictive analytics are enabling brands to offer highly personalized beauty products and experiences. The shift towards personalization represents a significant departure from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach, driven by growing consumer demand for products \nthat cater to individual needs.\nWe have also examined the technical challenges and potential \nsocial and cultural impacts associated with AI-driven beauty \ninnovations. While AI offers exciting possibilities, it also raises important concerns about accuracy, reliability, data privacy, and the potential to reinforce harmful beauty standards.\nImplications for the Beauty Industry\nThe implications of AI-driven personalization in cosmetics \nare far-reaching. For consumers, AI offers the promise of more \neffective and satisfying beauty products, tailored to their unique needs and preferences. For brands, AI represents a powerful tool for driving innovation, enhancing customer engagement, and staying competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\nLooking ahead, the continued evolution of AI technologies \nis likely to bring even greater levels of personalization and innovation to the beauty industry. However, it is crucial for brands to approach this transformation with a commitment to inclusivity, ethical practices, and consumer trust. By doing so, they can help ensure that the future of beauty is not only technologically advanced but also diverse, inclusive, and accessible to all.\n7.

Ann Marie Britton University of New Hampshire - Main Campus  (2012)  The literature overview \ndiscusses the pervasive influence of societal beauty standards on women, fuelled by \nadvertisements that present unrealistic images through photo -shopped models. This \nunattainable standard of beauty has led to feelings of inadequacy among women of all ages, \nshapes, and sizes. In 2008, the YWCA USA released a report titled \"Beauty at Any Cost,\" which \nhighlighted the consequences of this beauty obsession on women and gir ls in America. The \nreport revealed a significant impact on self -esteem and a substantial financial burden, with $7 \nbillion spent annually on cosmetics alone. Moreover, the cosmetic industry has seen a drastic \nrise in cosmetic surgeries, with a 500% increas e in procedures over the last decade. This \nobsession with beauty has given rise to a billion -dollar industry that wields considerable \ninfluence over women's perceptions of beauty. While numerous studies have explored the \nnegative effects of media on women' s self -image, fewer have specifically delved into the \ncosmetic industry's impact. Despite this gap, the staggering annual spending on cosmetics \nindicates a tangible influence on consumers. One of the initial studies on the subject, conducted \nby Marsha L. R ichins and Peter H.

During a rough \ntime on my life, both personally and physically, I successfully managed to conclude this \nresearch that, luckily, is related to  two of my biggest passions: beauty and adva nced \ntechnology  management.  \n \nI want to firstly thank my incredible supervisor , Professor  Ana Teresa Lehmann, who \nchallenged me to always give my best, and go beyond the boundaries of this research. Her \nhard work towar ds my research was inspiring. Dr. Ana never  gave up  on me and always g ave \nme the best , personal and professional, advice.  I hon estly enjoyed having worked with a \nwoman of proven success. Thank you, Professor.  \n \nSecondly, my school . FEP, will always be my se cond home  due to all the experiences, \nlearnings, amazing  colleagues , friends  who were  a source of inspiration. I  am proud of being \npart of this community of people who defy academic standards.  \n \nThirdly, to my amazing friends, who never doubt my strength an d capabilities to do this \ndissertation, always being patient, supporting and caring.  \n \nLastly, to my incredible family who g ave me the opportunity to achieve  anything and never \ngave up on my dreams . They showed me, once again, that there is nothing more im portant \nthan our strong relationship. Especially my mother, who is and will always be my role model.  \n \nThis dissertation is dedicated to all of those mentioned above  and to Arlete, Jo\u00e3o, Ester and \nGabi, my stars, who always guided my way.  \n \nQuoting one of Pink Floyd\u2019s lyrics:  \n \n\u201cTogether we stand, divided we fall.\u201d  \n \n \nIII \n \nA Intelig\u00eancia Artificial (IA) est\u00e1 a ser vez cada mais usada como uma ferramenta estrat\u00e9gica \npara tomar decis\u00f5es baseada s em dados, e funciona como um complemento para a tomada \nde deci s\u00e3o humana.

Al\u00e9m disso, h\u00e1 in\u00fameras necessidade s do consumidor \nde cosm\u00e9ticos a serem respondidas . Desta forma,  h\u00e1 uma forte necessidade de \npersonaliza\u00e7\u00e3o eficaz e estrat\u00e9gias de marketing direcionadas  a esses consumidores.  \nApesar d o t\u00f3pico ser relevante e das oportunidades destacadas acima, h\u00e1 uma es cassez de \ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o  te\u00f3rica e emp\u00edrica n este campo, o que fa z a quest\u00e3o  de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o : Como \u00e9 que \na IA est\u00e1 a impactar a ind\u00fastria da beleza na tomada de decis\u00f5es baseadas em dados?  \u2013 pertinente . \nDevido \u00e0 falta de estudos acad \u00e9micos sobre este t\u00f3pico , esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 de \u00edndole  \nexplorat\u00f3ri a, incluindo duas partes principais: (i) revis\u00e3o de literatura com base numa  \nframework  desenvolvida originalmente e (ii) um estudo emp\u00edrico qualitativo com base numa  \nan\u00e1lise de m\u00faltiplos casos de estudo .

This leads to more effective \nprocesses and drives innovation in a better way, enabling a stron g coordination betwee n all \nthe agents involved - such as managers, consumers , and partners. Digital transformation, \nwhich has AI at its core, has been disrupting companies\u2019 operations by provoking significant \nchanges on the value creation processes and bus iness models firms ad opt, with the increasing \nprevalence of digital platforms  using mechanisms and technologies like AI  and Machine \nLearning (ML) . The beauty industry is no exception to this trend, and the potential for \napplying AI in such sector is enormo us as it is a sector where there is a significant amount \nof data being produc ed across online platforms and social media channels. Furthermore, \nthere are infinite needs of the cosmetics consumer to be fulfilled, hence there is a strong \nneed for effective p ersonalization and ta rgeted marketing strategies.  \nDespite the relevance of t he topic and the considerable opportunities highlighted above, \nthere is a scarcity of theoretical and empirical research on the field, which makes th e present  \nresearch question - How is AI impacting t he beauty industry on making data -driven decisions? - \npertinent and worth investigating.  \nDue to the lack of academic studies on this topic, this dissertation has an exploratory nature, \nincluding two main parts :  (i) a literature revie w based on an origina lly developed framework \nand (ii) a qualitative empirical  study  based on a multiple case study analysis . The data was  \ncollected through in -depth semi -structured interviews  to top managers of two leading \ncompanies  in the beauty sector - L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Perfect C orp-, complemented by  data from \nsecondary sources.  \nThis dissertation had the following results: the interconnection between the latest \ntechnological trends,  strong collaboration between all the agents and an effective Big Data  \nmanagemen t are critical to sus tain a n AI strategy to make relevant deci sions  in this sector . \n \nKeywords:  Artificial Intelligence; Beauty Industry; Big Data; Consumer Behavior; Decision -\nMaking; Digital Platforms; Industry 4.0; Innovation; Interconnectivity; Online; O pen \nInnovation; Techn ology; User Innovation  \n \nV \n2.

Hence , one of the main challenges that companies face nowadays is integrating a nd \nexploiting new digital technologies (Hess, Matt, Benlian, & Wiesbock, 2016) .  \n \nThis digital transformation is related to what may be considered a chang e in techno -\neconomic paradigm (Freeman & Perez, 1988)  commonly called Industry 4.0 or Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution - where manufacturing processes are  undergoing changes t owards a \nmore digital environment.  Consequently, firms have been trying  to embrace digital \ntransformation on their processes and products along the value chain, affecting not only how \nthey operate but also their business model  (Klein, 2020) .  \n \nArtificial Intelligence  (AI) is a key strategic tool to foster the digital capabilities o f a company \npowered by Big Data  (Duan, Edwards, & Dwivedi, 2019) . AI harnesses the power of Big \nData  by intr oducing new mechanisms such as opinion mining and recommendation  systems \nwhich allow the companies to be more efficient and productive (Chui et al., 2018) . These \nmechanisms are enabled in a context where innovation is increasingly open (Chesbrough, \n2003) and democratized (von Hippel, 2005, 2016) , allowing external knowledge (of partners, \nusers and other stakeholders) to be part of the value creation process. Th e literature has also \nrecognized the phenomen on of \u201cuser innovatio n\u201d, in which consumers or other types of \nusers at large may be a relevant source of innovation, with producers or suppliers learn ing \nfrom them (Grabhe r, Ibert, & Flohr, 2008) . \n \nThe beauty industry was one of the first comme rcial sectors to embrace digital platforms and \nmaximize the power of large -scale data capturing and analytics to respond to customer \ndemand (Menear, 2019) . The value o f the beauty industry  is stated at more th an 500 billion \ndollars and it\u2019s expected to reach more than 800 billion dollars by 202 5 (Danziger, 2019) . \n \nThis market has been changing their business model (previously characterized  by a brick -\nand-morta r strategy ) towards a more digital one with a massive online presence (Biron, 2019) . \n2 \nthe individual ity and creating tailored products for each one of the ir consumers , putting these \nconsumers at th e core of the ir product creation process. These firms are leveraging \ntechnological development on their strategies in order to stay competitive in the market by \noffering personalized products and services (Brucculieri, 2018) , and AI can clearly offer \nrevolutionary possibilities in this domain.  \n \nDue to the technological advancements on AI technologies, and beauty being characterized \nas a per sonalized and engagin g market genera ting a massive amount of data, AI appears as a \nsolution to deal with this complex environment, leading the beauty companies to apply data -\ndriven decisions on their strategies in order to stay competitive.  \n \nThese firms ar e now empowered with digital technologies and capturing information from \nall the agents (consumers, partners, service providers) by storing data of many types, from \nalmost any source. Yet, this process of data capturing,  and storage only adds  value when it  \nhas a useful purpose  (Power, 2014) . By fostering data - driven processes, businesses are more \nlikely to improve their Return on Investment (ROI) and improving consumer loyalty.  \nTherefore, firms using these AI - and data -driven t echnologies are 23 times more likel y to \nconvert and 6 times more to retain the c ustomers  (Advance2000, 2018) . \n \nCompan ies like Sephora, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, PROVEN , among others, have already recognized such \npotential and are applying AI in different ways. For instance, AI has been reinventing  the \nway beauty b rands operate through  processes, providing much more efficient services, \nunderstanding consumer behavior, predict and plan demand, maximize supply chain \nchannels\u2019 potential  (Avvocato, 2019) .  \n \nEven if this is a phenomenon of foremost importance, there  are few theoretical and empirical \narticles explaining \u201chow a f irm can realize value from Big Data  using AI\u201d  (G\u00fcnther, Mehrizi, \nHuysman, & Feldberg, 2017, p. 192) . Moreover, regarding the Beauty Industry, there is a \nscarcity of quantitative and qualitative res earch on the field (o nly 26 articles found on the \nWeb of Science with \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201cAI\u201d topics\u2019 - compared to 2042 articles for \u201c health \u201d, for \nexample). To the best of our knowledge, there is no academic research on how beauty firms \n3 \n \nRegarding the structure of the dissertation, it will firstly consist of a thorough literatu re \nreview, starting b y analyzing  articles and publications with \u201cdata -driven decision making\u201d \nand \u201c AI\u201d as keywords  - and, if possible, with \u201cbeauty\u201d or \u201ccosmetics\u201d - on leading \nbibliographical databases such as Web Of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, etc. The use o f specific  \nkeywords w ill help to narrow down t o the relevant literature , in order to identify the main \nthemes pertinent to the focus of this dissertation  and to review the most important research . \n \nTo organize  the theoretical background underlying  this dis sertation, I develope d an original  \nframework to explain  three key concepts and articulate the interrelations between them: (i) \nEnabling Technology, (ii) Collaboration and (iii) Big Data  \u2013 reviewing in those sections the \nrelevant literature, and explaining after these three sec tions how AI is related to these crucial \nconcepts .  \n \nThe second main part of the dissertation includes an empirical research based on a qualitative \nmethodology give n on the one hand the scarce literature and data on this area \u2013 which \nmotivates the explorat ory nature of this study -, and on the other hand since it gives a more \ncomprehensive and an in -depth investigation of a complex issue (Creswell & Creswell, 2017) . \nThe qualitative research will include, firstly , an assessment with experts from the field to \nrefine the empirical methodology and map the questions  orienting the semi -structured \ninterview . And then, based on the interviews and complementary data gathered , a multiple \ncase studies -based empirical study w ill be developed, with a discussion of the respective \nfindings . It is expected that the results of t his dissertation will  shed light and contribute to \nthe almost non -existing academic literature on this area.  \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe literature review will focus  on the key topics mentioned below . It will be based on a \nsystematic search  and analysis  of articles and stud ies found on relevant databases such as \nWeb of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Research Gate, among others. Besides the \nacademic databases mentioned above, this dissertation will devote  special attention to the \nlatest business reports  focused on the integ ration of the  focal new technologies published by \ntop consulting firms such as Deloitte and McKinsey. Furthermore, due to the novelty of \nthese topics, portals focused on the beauty industry w ere also consulted . \n \nThe literature review is divided into three m ain parts . Firstly, it consist s of the presentation \nand analysis of an original ly developed framework . Secondly, explain s in detail the key \nconcepts highlighted on the framework such as Digital Transformation, Collaboration, Big \nData , Open and User Innovat ion, and AI. Due to the complexity and interactions of each \nconcept, the framework will also highlight how the topics are interrelated and \ninterdependent , according to the literature available.  \n \nLastly, the beauty industry is analyzed using the latest lite rature on the topic and drawing on \nexamples from brands that are competing  on the area under analysis . In the same section , \nthere will be an overview of how the industry is  being revolutionized by  AI, in what regards \nbusiness models . \n \n2.1. An original fram ework: proposal and analysis  \n \nThis dissertation aims at addressing  the research question \u201cHow is AI impacting the beauty  \nindustry on making data -driven decisions?\u201d . Since it involves the interaction between complex \nconcepts, a theoreti cal framework that serves as the foundation to understand the literature \navailable  was purposefully developed . Such  original framework support s the rationale of the \ndissertation  and helps  answer ing the proposed research question (Osanloo & Grant, 2016) . \nFurthermore, the use of a framework helps to st ructure the concepts highlighted and bring \nclarity to the investigation (Hennink , Hutter, & Bailey, 2 020). \n \n5 \napplication of  AI technologies  by companies.  These concepts are interrel ated, and a careful \naccount of their  bilateral interactions  helps explaining the complex phenomenon under \nanalysis . \n \nAfter the graphic presentation of the above -mentioned  framework, three sections follow, \neach addressing one of the thr ee key areas of the f ramework. S ection 2.2.1. develop s the \ntechnology aspect s that enable the adoption  of AI mechanisms. Section 2.2.2. explain s how \nuser and producer are working together across the value chain to innovate and create new \nproducts and servi ces. Section 2.2.3. e xplore s how Big Data  is being generated from these \nsynergies to fuel the ever-more digitalized ecosystem  we live in today . After, section 2.2.4 \nexplore s how these three major aspects result in, and are intrinsic to,  digital transformat ion \n- and are the fou ndation for the emergence of AI as a key tool in making data -driven \ndecisions . \n \n \n \nFigure 1:  Framework developed to address the current research question  \nSource:  Own elaboration.  \n6 \n2.2.1. Technology as an enabler to Digital Transformation  \n \nThis section explain s how d igital transfor mation is enabled by technolog y, exploring  \nconcepts such as Industry 4.0  and digital platform s. Then,  it analyze s how AI emerged from \nthis transformation and how it  is creating value in the firms.  \n \nDigital transformation has been defined as \u201ca process that  aims to improve an e ntity by triggering \nsignificant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and \nconnectivity technologies\u201d  (Vial, 2019, p. 3). The integration of these technologies will impact all \nparts of the companies\u2019 structure such as processes, sales channels and supply chains but it \nwill most likely bring productivity , more sales and new ways of engage with consume rs (Matt, \nHess, & Benlian, 2015) .  \n \nThe current phenomenon of digitalization of industry \u2013 called commonly Industry 4.0 - is \nintimately linked to this transf ormation \u2013 implying that  manufacturing processes will be more \ndigitalized  - involving the integration of cyber -physical systems  (Tay, Lee, Hamid, & Ah mad, \n2018) . The term Industry 4.0 , identified with the Fourth Industrial Revolution , originated in 2011 \nin Germany, at the Hannover Messe, the leading trade fair for industrial technologies . \nIndustry 4.0  was launched as  a strategy to differentiate  German and European Union \nindustries from their competitors, thus increasing the competitiveness of the former in  \ninternational markets (Pascall, 2017) . It refers to a \u201c further developmental stage in the organization \nand management of the entire value chain process involved in manufacturing industry\u201d  (Deloitte, 2015, p. \n3) and with the growth of th e impact of this transformation , companies face an opportunity \nto adopt technology at scale  and disseminate across the entire ecosystem (Schwab, 2018) . \nIndustry 4.0 allows for the development of new organizational capabilities (Nosalska, Pi\u0105tek, \nMazurek, & Rz\u0105dca, 2019)  enabl ing the implementation of digital platforms in the value \ncreation process (Kagermann, Helbig, Hellinger, & Wahlst er, 2013)  by developing innovative \nproducts which inv olves the interconnection of different types of agents  (Tay et al., 2018) .  \n \nConnected with digital transformation a nd Industry 4.0 is the concept of digital platforms. \nIt is estimated that 70% of new value creation in the economy over the next 10 years will be \nbased on digital platforms (Schwab, 2018) . Digital platforms  represent \u201c a digital technology -\n7 \n& Voigt, 2019, p. 6)  Digital platforms have high scalabil ity and  low transaction costs \nachieving network effects (Gawer & Cusumano, 2014)  when the number of users increases, \nthe product of the service or product value increase s as well.  \n \nThe rise of an economy based on  digital platforms (or \u201cthe platform economy\u201d)  poses a \nsignificant challenge for organizations  (Chan, Voortman, & Rogers, 2019) . Digital p latform s \ncompel the interaction between agents  and play a key role on this environment since they \nreduce costs and economic friction (Evans & Schmalensee, 2008) . Furthermore, business \nmodels are d ependent on how the competition is playing to stay competitive. Tirole and \nRochet (2003) analyze how this platform competition on two -sided markets  works, stating \nthat markets with network externalities \u201ccross -subsidize\u201d different types of users that are \npart of the transactions on the platforms. This means that the total profit dep ends on the \ntotal price charged to the parties involved on the transaction and on its decomposition  \n(Rochet & Tirole, 2003) .  \n \nThis transformation is reshaping bus iness models , leading to the integrati on of  digital \nplatforms across the entire value chain with the  main goal of staying competitive in the \nindustry, improving performance. Companies are embracing a digital transformation \nstrategy, where integration of al l the agents such as consumers, suppliers, competitors is the \nkey driver  of this era  (Hess et al., 2016) . \n \nTechnologie s such as Internet of Things (IoT), AI, additive manufacturing, cloud computing , \nrobotic process automation, ML, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, 3 D Printing, virtual \nagents,  are part of the creation of th ese valuable networks in order to have a dynamic , real-\ntime and self -organized company  (Tay et al., 2018) . Companies have been i ntegrating these \ntechnologies in their business strategies, conducting not only to a significant increase in \ninvestment and adoption , but also to making sure that the technical foundation is in place in \norder to be effective  (Chui et al., 2018) .  \n \nAmong those technologies highlighted above, one (and a crucial one) of them is AI. AI is a \nleading component and driver of the digital transformation across industries,  disrupting the \n8 \n2019) . With a given objective, AI uses software to perceive the environment, interpreted by \nan algorithm in order to predict, recommend and make decisions (OECD, 2019) . \n \nWith the advent of AI, new definitions of the term have arisen for better understanding of \nits purpose. Modern definitions see AI as sub -field of computer science, shifting from a \ntraditional approach of machines imitating human i ntelligence to being human -like (Bughin, \nSeong, Manyika, Chui, & Joshi, 2018) . IBM describe s AI as a \u201cshorthand to describe any machines \nthat mimic our cognitive functions such as \u201clearning \u201d and \u201cproblem solving \u201d\u201d (IBM, n.d) . \n \nAI is playing an incr easing ly important role in the  economy . By 2030, t he additional output \nenabled by its application   is expected to reach  13 trillion dollars , and companies are expected \nto do uble their cash -flow (Zhao, 2018) . This is a result of the progress on key areas that are \ndisrupting both economies and companies  such as improvement  in computer power and \ncapacity, generating of dat a and the significant progress in algorithms  (Chui et al., 2018) . \n \nFor the adoption of these mechanisms to be effective, the technical infrastructure needs to \nact as the foundation alongside with the collaboration of skilled labor and experience. \nFurthermore, since the choice of adopting AI is likely to impact the outcomes , the adoption \nstrategy needs to be carefully thought to improve the absorption across the firm  (Bughin et \nal., 2018)  \n \n2.2.2. Collaboration and value  exchange between  differe nt stakeholders  \n \nAnother aspect that is crucial to the emergence of digital transformation is collaboration and \nhow it impacts the daily operations of firms. It  is of foremost importance to understand how \nthe interconnectivity between  all the agents change  the business models  and firms\u2019  \nperformance.  \n \nCollaboration (and connectivity) is a defining feature at the core of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 \nallows products, machines, components, individuals and systems to create a smart network \n(Kamble, Gunasekaran, & S harma, 2018) . The customers\u2019 role and the growth of social \nnetworks is allowing for more inclusion through the  introduction of new forms of \n9 \nonly relying  on technology, but also on a strong collaboration between stakeholders  - \npartners, customers,  and suppliers  (Tay et al., 2018)  transitioning from a centralized \nproduction to a more flexible and self -controlled  production model  (Nosalska e t al., 2019) . \n \nInnovation is a process that is deployed across different types of agents  across society and \nthe economy : public or private firms, the State, universities,  and nonprofit institutions \n(Lundvall, 1992) . That has evolved through the years. At first, innovation started in -house \nwith research, moved to industrial application and then, if succ essful, w ould lead to the \nproduct placement in the market. This traditional a pproach to innovation is essentially based \non control and ownership as the factor to stay competitive  and create value  (Chesbrough & \nAppley ard, 2007) .  \n \nDue to the increasing interconnectivity of agents, internet, globalization and competitiveness, \ncompanies needed to fill the high demand of the market  in a different way . Firms move d \nfrom a \u201cclosed\u201d science -driven innovation to an \u201copen\u201d lea rning driven innovation where \nall the actors are involved on a continuous way (Marques, 2014) . The open innovation model \nwas developed by Chesbrough (2003) and is defined as: \u201cDistributed inno vation process based on \npurposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non -pecuniary \nmechanisms in line with each organization\u2019s business model\u201d  (Chesbrough & Bogers, 2014, p. 3) . The \nbalance between traditional and  open innovation  aims to increase the value creation across \nfirms , and the introduction of, and col laboration between , outside innovators  is of the \nforemost importance to companies who lead through innovation (Chesbrough & Appleyard, \n2007) . \n \nIncreased digitalization influences a vast array of business activities by enabling new forms \nof cooperation (Rachinger, Rauter, M\u00fcller, Vorr aber, & Schirgi, 2019) . These new fo rms of \ncooperation allow for a significant interchange of knowledge: valuable ideas can come from \ninside or outside the company and can go to the market from inside or outside the company \nas well, and consequently, indu strial innovation is becoming more op en  (Chesbrough, 2003) . \nThus, an open innovation strategy requires  a change al ong the business model considering  \nnew sources of value capturing and value creation  (Chesbrough & Appleyard, 2007) . \n10 \ninnovation p rocess, including users, adding value to the firm (Marques, 2014) . Extensive \ntheoretical and empirical research has now led to an understanding that users are also a major \nsource of innovation  development  (von Hippel, 1986; von Hippel & Riggs, 1997) . This \nmeans that now producers tend to learn from users on how they should create their product s \nthrough co -develop ment, transforming the product into a variable  (Grabher et al., 2008) . \n \nDue to open innovation, and to user innovation, innovation is becoming democratized, \nmeani ng that users of  products and services \u2014 both firms and individual consumers \u2014are \nincreasingly able to innovate  for themselves, resulting in the creation of individually and \ncommercially important new products and services  (von Hippel, 2005) . von Hippel argues \nthat users are reinventing  the products to serve their own needs and  companies are taking \nadvantage by discovering, adapting, and capitalizing on these  innovations (von Hippel & \nMange lsdorf, 2011) . These innovative users are often called as \u201clead users\u201d , a term coined \nby von Hippel . Lead users are \u201c users whose present strong needs will become general in a marketplace \nmonths or years in the future \u201d (von Hi ppel, 1986, p. 791) . These type of users can bring relevant \ninputs both on design and concept to the companies, so they can be part of  the process of \nspotting future opportunities, understand the needs of new products  and services and \nconsequently, compa nies can benefit from this information to develop their strategies (von \nHippel &  Riggs, 1997) .  \n \nLatest developmen ts on data capture and consumer behavior enabled a new way of spotting \nlead users amongst the web  ecosystems . Track ing all the user -generated content and their \nreviews can be time consuming and costly, which leads to new ways of spotting consumers \noutputs . Data mining appears as solution to detect  trends and opinions that might be relevant \nto the communit y. Through the analysis of their preferences, their online  behavior , \norganizations can integrate consumer\u2019s needs  and adapt to their needs  leading to succe ssful \nproducts that came directly from their ideas   (Kaulartz & von Hippel, 2019) . \n \nCombining machines, systems and  different type of  individuals, digital platforms are \nexpected to drive innovation and collaboration between these agents by easing the \ncommunication and coordination  (Esposito De Falco, Renzi, Orlando, & Cucari, 2017) . \n11 \nLastly, all the activities that are performed across the firms are daily fueled by data and, also, \nby the very creation  of data . It is a challenge to organize and maximize the value  that data \nbrings,  in order to make business decisions. This chapter explai ns how the dimensions of \nBig Data  and the interac tions between the all agents involved impact the knowledge creation \nacross the value chain.  \n \nDigital transformation  has one key factor that enables technological development: data \ncapturing and storage  (Junge, Verhoeven, Reipert, & Mansfeld, 2019) . According to \nInternational Data Corporation  (Rydning, 2 018) it is estimated that the production of data \nwill go up to 1 75 zettabytes  by 2025  (\u201cA single zettabyte contains one sextillion bytes, or one billion \nteraby tes. That means it would take one billion one terabyte hard drives to store one zettabyte of d ata\u201d- \n(Christensson, 2012, p. 1) ) by 2025 , 10 times higher than 2016 , achieving an opportunity to \nextra ct value now more than ever before. The world is  producing data with more speed, \ndisrupting enterprises by introducing innovative technologies being more pr oductive and \nincreasing consumer surplus  (Manyika, 2011) . \n \nSince the amount of data increased on the last years alon gside with the complexity that \nevolved on  the process of data capturing and storing, some academics such as Charles Tilly \nand John R. Mashey  introduced a new term called Big Data  (Diebold, 2012) . According to \nProvost and Fawcett (2013), it\u2019s defined as \u201cdata sets that are too large for traditional data -processing \nsystems and that therefore require new tech nologies\u201d  (Provost & Fawcett, 2013, p. 54) . Consequently, \nfirms rely on a strong technical architecture to support data capturing and storage, enhancing \nonce again the importance of t echnological strategies on the process of digital \ntransformation.  \n \nBusinesses  are using data in order to generate value through data manipulation technologies, \nsuch as retrospective, predictive and prescriptive analysis  (Power, 2014) . Through these \nprocesses, firms can harness the power that Big Data  can br ing, by us ing it to the \ndevelopment of innovative insights, products,  and services (Davenport, Ba rth, & B ean, \n2012) . All the inflows are stored on data warehouses that can empower the decision -maker \nagents with a strong foundation of fact. But , this type of warehouses doesn\u2019t concern an \nimportant aspect on making decisions: tacit knowledge. Knowledge warehou ses are \n12 \nit will help the decision -makers to detect new patterns, understan d the relations between \nthem and provide explanations. Thus, knowledge warehouses can improve the decision -\nmakers processes by using AI mec hanisms and amplify the rationale behind each decision \n(Nemati, Steiger, Iyer, & Herschel, 2002) . \n \nBig Data  is considered critical for comp anies to be competitive in the market  (Grewal & \nRoggeveen, 2017)  since the development of new technologies and the changes on shopping \nbehavior are affecting how the firms operate every day. However , having a competitive \nadvantage based on data is temporary, so companies need to have a certain level of flexibility \nto adapt to market changes (Baierle, Sellitto, Fr ozza, Schaefer, & Habekost, 2019) . \n \nAI automat es cognitive and physical tasks through the capturing and storage of data \n(Saratchandran, 2019) . This mech anism is bidirectional since it can answer and question the \nconsumer by responding to queries and making suggestions, targeting  more effectively the \nusers (Grewal & Roggeveen, 2017) . Due to the oscillation of the markets, there are emerg ing \nplatforms that according to the authors above \u201c forces\u201d that will disrupt the retailing industry \nand one of them is AI, the focus of this dissertation  (Grewal & Roggeveen, 2017) . \n \n2.2.4 AI and its relation with the th ree major  concept s highlighted : \ntechnology, collaboration, and Big Data  \n \nSections 2. 2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3 aim ed to explain the dimensions of the framework and serve as \nthe conceptual base to introduce the topic of this dissertation. One can conclude that  \ntechnology enable s digital transformation , the capture and storage of Big Data  and the \nincreasing participation of all the agents through collaboration. AI is a mechanism that \ncombines and relies on these three  dimensions but there is still very scarce  academic research \nexplain ing how AI can unleash the power of Big Data  and its impact on making decisions \n(Duan et al., 2019) . \n \nUsing  information, AI will manipulate and store the data, easing its access, making it available \nfor any purpose at any time, serving as a basis for decision -making  (Baierle et al., 2019) . \nDecision -making has the main goal of changing the current state to a more desirable one and \n13 \nbut it will not eliminate human involvement at all. Decision-makers should be able to \nquestion the output and expla in the reasoning behind the assumptions and their variables  \n(Curry &  Moutinho, 1994) . \n \nWith the increase of computer power and data storage, AI will augment human intelligence, \nenabling the process of decision -making (Saratchandran, 2019) . Moreover, academic \nresearch shows that humans and algorithms should complement each other by enhancing \ntheir unique competencies and capabilities (Bader & Kaiser, 2019) , showing once again, the \nrelevance of the collaboration dimension.  \n \nThe adoption of AI on decision -making impl ies that organizational structure s need to be \nchanged . Firstly, firms nee d to judge their capabilities and how they can find an opportunity \nto adopt AI on their b usiness models . The analysis of the implementation of AI on the \nprocesses across the value chain will help f irms on their assessment and how they can \nincorporate AI to make decis ions (Paschen, Pitt, & Kietzmann, 2020) . Recent studies from \nShrestha, Ben -Menahem, and Von Krogh (2019) , for example, show that there are different  \nstructures of decision -making processes on integrating AI. Consequently, comp anies need \nto choose which is the best option for their business model so they can exploit the human \ncapabilities and algorithm decision -making in order to enable better decision s (Shrestha et \nal., 2019) . \n \nThere are many strategies that can unleash and improve the performance of the companies \nusing AI on making decisions.  It is expected that , by 202 5, AI will have a 40 billio n dollars \nimpact on marketing (Reavie, 2018) . Real-time data gathering will help firms to predict \nconsumer behavior and better target what they want, helping firms to dec ide which is the \nbest marketin g strategy for each type of consumer . One strategy mentioned above was using \nAI to provide recommendation tools to help the marketing and the customer service team (s) \nto tailor the content displayed according to consumer prefe rences and feedbacks  (Baierle et \nal., 2019; Saratchandran, 2019; Shin et al., 2019) . \n \n14 \nMoreover, it will also improve the process of demand forecasting through the use  of \ncustomer relationship programs  (Campbell, Sands, Ferraro, Tsao, & Mavrommatis, 2020)  \nthat are key to understa nd the consumers.  \n \nFirms are now implementing the strategies stated above to impr ove their decision -making \nand engage the consumer across all the touchpoints on the buyer journey, making them more \ninterested and curious about the products (Shin et al., 2019) . \n \nGiven all that was explained in this section, it is c lear that AI  implies the three dimensions \nmentioned above (technology, collaboration and Big Data ), and that it represents a powerful \ntool to improve decision -making and firm performance.  \n \n2.3. Beauty industry analysis and the impact of AI  \n \nHistorically, the beauty industry had its first appearance on the Roman Society. Fragrance  \nwas the first category to appear on the market since oils and perfumes  were used to cure the \nBlack Death. Furthermore, Louis XIV, French king, stimulated the luxury within its soci ety \nwhich helped to boost the production.  Consequently, France  was the first region to be \nconsidered the capital of fashion and luxury , especially Paris . By the end of the XIX century , \nthe beauty market  turned itself into a capitalist industry. It  was char acterized by a range of  \nprices , which changed due to the customer relationship stablished with each consumer on \nthe department stores.  The beauty business model back then had the goal to expand to more \ntypes of people, going to an international expansion, and go further on the type of products \noffered, such as powders, creams. As any other business, beauty was strongly dependent of \nthe society and its political implications. World wars had relevant impact on the production \nand growth of the market. Neverthe less, some companies managed to survive and found an \nopportunity to advertise soap since \u201cwar\u201d was associated with \u201cdirt\u201d . An example is Procter  \n& Gamble , who  enjoyed its first -mover advantage and capitalized on this product through \nadvertisement and diffe rentiated packaging  (Jones, 2010) . \n \n15 \nconstant change of lifestyle of the consume rs, the increased of  brands created , and the \ndevelopment of new ingredients  contribute to the growth of this market . The cosmetics \nmarket  compris es skincare, make -up, haircare, oral care, fragrances, toiletries, deodorants  \nand generally,  are mixtures of ch emicals  that enhance the appearance or smell  of the human \nbody (Rajput, 2016 ) being skincare the leading categor y as the most profita ble (Shahbandeh, \n2020) . \n \nThe beauty industry is characterized as profitable, innovative,  and fast -paced  (Haddara, \nHsieh, Fagerstr\u00f8m, Eriksson, & Sigur\u00f0sson, 2020) . The key to succeed in this market is to \nquickly create new products , satisfying  to the needs  and prefe rences of  each consumer  \nthrough the development of brand -new products, their replacement or  their upgrade  \n(Kumar, Massie, & Dumonceaux, 2006) . Speed and flexibilit y act as the key factors to be \neffective on this market, a longside a constant cons umer liste ning. Answering to customer\u2019s \nnew preferences as early as possible and involve the m in product development are critical to \nthe beauty compan ies\u2019 success  (Haddara et al. , 2020) . A quarter of all the beauty products are \nnew or improved each year  (Haddara et al., 2020) . Furthermore,  for the make -up category, \nthe product lifecycle tends  to be short due to the color variations that it  has. On the other \nhand, soaps,  facial products have a higher product life cycle . The industry needs to satisfy \neach con sumer need fast in order to stay competitive  (Kumar et al., 2006) . \n \nCompared to the previous century, t he beauty industry has integra ted innovation and digital \ntransformation , improving  its online presence changing their previous brick -and-mortar \nbusiness model.  Yet, 80.7% of global beauty sales are made in store, the rese arch and \ndiscovery start online (Coresightresearch, 2019) .  \n \nBeauty companies are leveraging their online presence with the purpose of raising awareness \nand, g enerate revenue in order to scale faster (Kestenbaum, 2019) . With  the globa l e-\ncommerce phenomenon, brands have been also been launched exclusively online like \nVictoria Beck ham Beauty (Barr, 2019) . This means that the beauty market is following an \nomnichannel path which comb ines the benefits of offline and online experiences through \nwebsites, retailers,  and stores.  \n16 \npersonalized services, there is a massive amount of data created every day an d a strong need \nfor recommendation systems (Shin et al., 2019) . This amount of data that is being created  is \nan opportunity to the beauty companies, as they have the ability to understand better the  \nconsumers, hear them, and engage with them, involving thus the consumers on p roduct \ncreation (Haddara et al., 2020) . There  are infinite needs of the consumer to be fulfilled,  hence \nthere is a strong need for effective personalization and targeted marketing strategies .  \n \nTechnologies  like AI have been infiltrating the industry over the past few years  and are \nexpected to grow in the upcoming coming years, with revenues increasin g from around 9.5 \nbillion U.S. dollars in 2018 to an expected 118.6 billion by 2025 (Liu, 2020)  and its impact is \nlikely to be most substantial in marketing as well as supply chain management (Chui et al., \n2018) . These technologies are mainly used by major corporations, government, agencies but \nthe ones that better benefit fro m AI are services that are daily fueled by data like the beauty \nmarket (Shin et al., 2019) . Most of the companies in beauty are already implementing AI on \ntheir strategies to stay competitive in the market. For example, Sephora had a  revenue growth \nof 11% on the first quarter, after they launched the Sephora Virtual A rtist, tool  that allows \ncustomers to \u201ctry on\u201d the products they want   (Troyer, 2019)  among other examples that \nwill be studied throughout the empirical research.  \n \nThe global investment for AI including Fashion, Luxury, and Cosmetics \u2013 is expected to \ngrow to $7 .3 billion by 2022 . These mechanisms on the beauty market are changing the way \nbrands operate by providing 10x more efficient services (Avvocato, 2019) . \n \n  \n17 \n3.1. Empirical Methodology  \n \nThis section aims to explain the methodol ogy underlying the empirical part of this research.   \n \n3.1.1 Qualitative Research   \n \nEmpirical academic research can be performed using qualitative or quantitative \nmethodol ogies , or both . Quantitative research aims to quantify or measure a problem,  using \nstatistical or other type of purposefully gathered data. On the other hand , qualitative research \nhas the purpose of understanding \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d within a context  of a certa in \nphenomenon  (Hennink et al., 2020) , and is often used when there are no data available, \ntypically in tackling recent phenomena .  \n \nOn this topic,  there is no database available to  draw upon , or any quantitative study to build \na solid  statistical  foundation  to enable a quantitative study . Adding to that, AI in the beauty \nindustry is a novel  and rec ent strategy  and some companies are already testing these advanced \ntechnologies. Howev er, there is not  a general application to all the companies, which makes \nit harder to find patterns and quantify the research question.   \n \nAccording to Yin (2015), there a re certain  key factors that differentiate qualitative research  \nsuch as to understand ing a person\u2019s role, representing their opinions on a given context and \nadd value to contemporary situations through explanatory methodologies, through the use \nof different  data sources (Yin, 2015) . Given all these aspects, qualitative research appears as \nthe best strategy to answer th is research question . \n \n3.1.2 Multiple Case Stud y Methodology  \n \nThe methodology used in this empirical part of the dissertation, of a q ualitative nature as \njustified above, will rely on case studies from the beauty industry. Paraphrasing Starman \n(2013) , \u201cinterpretative paradigm, phenomenological approach , and construct ivism as a paradigmatic basis of \nqualitative research are closely linke d to the definition and characteristics of case studies\u201d (Starman, 2013 , \np. 30) . The analysis of case studies appears as  the best strategy to answer researc h questions \nwhere its main goal is understanding \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d, allowing the researcher to enter an \n18 \nin fields such as management (Starman, 2013) .  \n \nTo define a case study, is important to understand if the inquiry e xamines a \u201ccontemporary \nphenomenon in its real -life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not \nclearly evident\u201d  (Yin, 1981, p. 97) . Since this r esearch aims to understand and explain how AI \nis impacting the beauty industry, or in other words, explain the knowledge utilization process, \nthen the case stud y approach is the most adequate.  \n \nThis methodology brings advantages such as the exploration of  ideas, what happened, \nexplain and deep dive on complex and unique situations. Further more, there is a freedom to \ncollect a range of different sources of data , being essential to explore in -depth the case \n(Essays, 2018) . \nDue to all these conditions and th e explanations above, the analysis of case studies  was \ndeemed  the appropriate methodol ogy to report on this emerging phenomenon .  \n \nAfter deciding that the empirical part of this dissertation should be based on the analysis of \ncase studies, it was also deci ded that a multiple case study methodology should be \nimplemented, in order to make the  analysis richer and more representative of a  diversity of \nstrategies happening in the beauty industry \u2013 thus allowing for better addressing the r esearch \nquestion. As Yin (2009)  defended, using different case studies gives a more synergistic an d \ncomprehensive view of the issue being studied . Moreover, given that the industry under \nanalysis is quite  diverse , with multiple brands actively competing in the market , and \nimplementing different strategies as will be developed subsequently . Even though the cases \nmight be different, e ach case study should be analyzed in -depth  and its compilation should \nbe intended to be the foundation for further replication and confirma tion (Yin, 1981) . \nAdding to that,  is important to find differen t companies , not only on their sector, but also \non their  business strategies so it  may be  possible to anticipate all of the scenarios and serve \nall of the points of view  (Greene & David, 1984) . \n \nThe construction of these case studies w as based on the analysis of primary and secondary \nsources, explained in the section below.  \n19 \nThe data collection methodolo gy was based  on th e analysis of primary and secondary \nqualitative data .  \n \nIn terms of primary sources, i t was decided to gather data through interviews . The research \ninterview is considered one of the most relevant strategies to conduct a qualitative data \ncollection a nd it can provide a rich amount of data  (Qu & Dumay, 2011) .  \n \nThis resear ch will have the input from interviews to experts on the beauty area that are \ndealing with AI on their business strategies. Their functions are based on business \ndevelopm ent, data science, or any role that is intrinsically related to AI. The interviewees \nwere contacted through LinkedIn  and work e -mails.  It was not an easy process as high level \nexecutives were targeted (s they are in charge of AI -related decisions), and the  current context \nof the Covid -19 pandemic made the study much more difficult and chall enging \u2013 implying \nthat certain  executives were very hard to contact and confirm. Still, the main companies of \ninterest were interviewed.  \n \nThe information  from the intervi ews helped to define the scope of analysis and to map \nposition the key case studies on  the area under research . It was decided to use semi-structured \ninterviews, as this type of interview involves systematic questioning (Qu & Dumay, 2011)  - \nfor example including questions that have a \u201clikert scale\u201d which will help the int erviewer to \nmap the importance of the areas under analysis . Plus, this type of interview includes open \nquestions so the interview ee can complement the information obtaine d in questions with \nstructured answer options . This type of approach is relevant since  it allows the e xpert to \nshare in greater qualitative detail their experiences which can be fundamental to develop the \nanalysis and the scope of cases to be studied (Muylaert, Sarubbi Jr, Gallo, Neto, & Reis, \n2014) . This type of interviews  appears to be the best strategy  for this dissertation because it \nallows the interviewees to freely develop their ideas and their experience on the environment \nof the cas e study , enabling answers from their personal understanding of how AI is impacting \nthe beauty industry (Qu & Dumay, 2011) . \n \n20 \nWith this objective,  an in -depth analysis of publicly available content such as compan ies\u2019 \nwebsites, electronic articles, press releases, among other relevant sources, was conducted.  \n \n3.1.4 The survey instrument and its structure  \n \nThe questionnaire purposefully designed for this dissertation is divided in to three main parts:  \ngeneral information about the company , general questions at a corporate level , and  specific \nquestions for each case stu dy. The complete and detailed version of the survey instrument \ncan be found in Annex 1 to this dissertation. This part is a summary of the survey instrument  \nunderpinning the interviews.  \n \n\u2022 General information about the company  \nThis part  aims to obtain releva nt information about the company such as:  global \nheadquarters, size of the company (re garding size of the employees and turnover from the \nlast year), strategic business units, international spread, among others. This input will help to \nunderstand important  aspects about the company  and to draw so me conclusions regarding \nits organization. Al so, it will help to compare the different companies on how they are \ninternally structured  and key strategic geographical areas .  \n \n\u2022 General questions at a corporate level  \nThis part  is divided in to four main sections  related to , and being coherent with, the \nframework developed for the purpose of this dissertation mentioned on the literature review.  \nThey involve questions that evaluate technology as an enabler of digital trans formation, \ncollaboration, Big Data  and AI . Given the interrelations between these area s, and the object \nof the present study and its reference to key literature reviewed, it was decided to organize \nthis part of the questionnaire as follows:   \n \n(a) Innovation Process : The questions will address how the innovation process flow s \nin the mentioned co mpany. These questions will ask if the innovation is done in -\nhouse or if it is outsourced , and it will help to understand if the company uses \u2018open \ninnovation\u2019 on their s trategies. Also, the quest ions on this section will address \u2018user \n21 \nconsumers are sources of inf ormation for the internal development of the company\u2019s \nstrategy, and how they capture the data.  \n \n(b) Use of digital technologies:  On this section, the interviewee will tell which a re the \ntechnologies being used by the company. The interviewee will evaluate it s rate of use, \nits relative importance to achieve strategic goals, and which are the k ey performance \nindicators . This approach will help to understand how developed the company is in \nterms of advanced technologies and to what extent they are being used.  \n \n(c) Application of AI: The questions will approach how AI is deployed across the \ncompany , the changes on the organizational structure and if it is a priority to integrate \nmore AI projects in the future. The answers will help to understand how the \ncompany is ha ndling with the integration of AI on their strategy, how employees are \nworking and its  impact on the company structure.  \n \n(a) Decision -making:  This section aims to understand how the decision -making flows \nin the company and how AI is impacting it.  \n \n\u2022 Specific qu estions about the selection of a specific  AI-related  mechanism by \nthe interviewed comp any \nThis part of the questionnaire will help to understand some key aspects related to a chosen \nAI-related mechanism , in order to dive in detail  in that particular case . The questions will \naddress how the company f ound the opportunity to launch the mechani sm/product, its \nprocess of implementation and how was the collaboration among all the agents involved. It \nwill also address if was worthwhile to launch the project compar ing to others that do not  \nrequire AI , and on which measures. Furthermore, this dissert ation tries to  assess how and to \nwhat extent decision -making is /has been  impacted by AI, and how the company will \napproach this area in the future.  \n \n  \n22 \nThis section analyzes  the case studies selected to answer th is dissertation\u2019s research question . \nThe case s were chosen to cover the diversity of the beauty industry.  \n \nOn the business to business (B2B) side , we will analyze Perfect Cor p, a company that \nprovides beauty -tech solutions to the brands want ing to implement a digital strategy that \nincludes AI mechanisms . The apps of the firm have already been downloaded 700 million \ntimes having a 60 million monthly active users (Shu, 2019) . Among other achievements, \nPerfect Corp. w on the Edison Award , create d by Thoma s Edison , which honors the leading \ninnovations on a certain industry - on the Innovative Services Catego ry this year  (Awards, \n2020) . Their advancements in AI, AR and ML on the retail landscape were recognized \nalongside the progress of their main platform, YouCam , explained in detail i n section 3.2.1. . \nThe Senior Vice President  and Chief Strat egy Officer, Louis Chen,  shared his insights on \nhow the firm is dealing with AI on the ir strategy and their relationship with their clients \u2013 \ni.e. the brands that want to use these advanced technologies on their operational strategy.  \n \nOn the business to consumer side  (B2C) , L\u2019Or\u00e9al, one of the industry \u2019s leaders (Balon, 2019) , \nwas chosen. L\u2019\u00d3real  compet es in the market with over 20 brands  (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -j). The case \nfocuses on how L\u2019Or\u00e9al is implementing AI strategies on their business, with the input of \nJorge Sucena, Marketing Director of L\u2019\u00d3real Portugal . L\u2019Or\u00e9al has been shaping \ntechnological advances in the beauty industry, which led them to acquire for the first time a \nnon-beauty brand , considered as the \u201c creators of AR tech for the beauty industry\u201d  (Simsek, 2018) . \nThis integration allowed them to continue their digital accelera tion strategy , giving them \ncompetitive advantage  for being on the frontline of new advanced beauty -tech related \ntechnologies.  \n \nAdding to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, on the B2C side, this dissertation will analyze PROVEN , considered as \nthe \u201cTesla of  skincare\u201d (DeAcetis, 2020) , a company that has the largest skincare database \nand with the input from the consumer, matches their data , creating an unique and customized \nproducts using AI and ML mechanisms.  The researcher tried to contact several managers  of \nthe company through Linkedin  and e -mail, but with no response to e nquiry. This case study , \ndeemed very important for the purposes of this dissertation, will be based on secondary \nsources such as website information, press releases, publ ished  interviews, among others.  \n23 \n\u2022 Background  on the company  \nPerfec t Corp is a tech nological  company founded in 201 4 by Alice Chang  (Crunchbase , n.d-\na). Perfect Corp.  is owned by CyberLink, a digital media software developer  (Shu, 2019) .  It \nemploys 230 workers across the globe  and does not disclose turnover numbers (Chen, 2020) .  \nThe firm operates  on the beauty industry and provides technologies mainly focused on AR \nand AI that aim to disrup t the c onsumer beauty journey (PerfectCorp., n.d -a). Their globa l \nheadquarters and R&D centers are in  Taipei and they have global teams spread around the \nworld . Perfect Corp is present on 1 1 countries with global sales and support offices, but the \nmost important ones are in New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Paris,  and Taipei  (Chen, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 Technology as an enabler to Dig ital Transformation  \nPerfect Corp.  offers consumer -centric solutions in order to better understand and adapt to \nevery consumer needs on an omnichannel approach  with the use  of advanced technology . \nThe technologies developed b y the company  have changed the w ay brands and retailers \ninteract with beauty consumers, both in store and digitally, through the integration of cut ting-\nedge precision analysis and recommendation tools cr eating interactive journeys to every type \nof consumers (PerfectCorp., n.d -b).  \n \nThe creation of those technologie s requires the usag e of internal mechanisms and digital \ntools . Louis  Chen , when asked , stated that User Social Networks, Virtual Reality, AR, Cloud \nComputing and ML are the most used and the  important ones to achieve strategic goals. The \nmanager  also added the importance of processing large amounts of data, and that capability \nis also of extremely use and achieve their strategic goals. In terms of measurement of these \ntools, or, in other word s, Key Performance  Indicators (KPIs), Louis Chen focused his answer \non the importance  of the accuracy and the speed  of the platforms/services . These two KPIs \nare the key factors that give the end-consumer a better experience, and successful ly use the \nappli cations  (Chen, 2020) . \n \nHowever, the interviewe e mentioned  that it is important to analyze these KPIs and integrate \nthem on an overall value proposition . The value accrued  from  the technologies stated above \nis based on  solving the problems of the consumer. The brands that apply these technologies \n24 \n \nConcluding, Perfect Corp. analyzes the technological value on two different ways. They aim \nto deliver the most accurate and fastest resource to their consumers, in this case, the brands \nthat want to integrate t heir beauty -tech solutions. Adding to that, t hey also rely on e -\ncommerce KPI s from th e brands so they can understand if there is a window of opportunity \nto improve their performance as well  (Chen,  2020) . \n \n\u2022 Collaboratio n and value exchange between different stakeholders  \nPerfect Corp is at the intersecti on between consumers, content creator\u2019s  beauty brands  and \nretailers that  are interacting together by introducing cutting -edge products such as: virtual \ntry-ons, skincare d iagnosis, in -store consultation, between others  (PerfectCo rp., n.d -a). The \ncompany ha s strategic partnerships with major retailers such as Ali baba where they can \nimprove new virtual try -outs to Chinese consumers wit h the use of YouCam , their main \nplatform  (Perfect Corp., 2019a ).  \n \nPerfect Corp offers its services to beauty companies  and retailers , but consumers are also \npart of their target market.  YouCam Makeup, YouCam Perfect, YouCam Video, \nYouCamNails, YouCamFun  are apps that engage directly with the users through  selfies  \nretouch, try -on of different products, applying accessories, among others, without involving \nthe brand , original concept of Perfect Corp.  (Corp., n.d -b). However, on Youcam Shop, \nusers can select from a range of products which are the ones they want to try before  buy and  \npurchase them directly in -app (Corp., n.d -d). \n \nThe devices that s upport these apps have been evolving over the past years too. Louis Chen \nmentioned th e importance  of the release of new features on smartphone s. A great example \nis the integration of advanced cameras. For the  Perfect Corp. leader  their innovation  is driven  \nby the advancement of those technologies itself. At the company, the department in c harge \nof the innovation, analyze the technology and find an application for it, counting with the \ninputs from other teams such as marketing. They prototype and then test w ith the brands if \nit\u2019s usable in the beauty market or not  (Chen, 2020) . \n \n25 \nPerfect Corp. and discuss between themselves the best solut ion and , sometimes , they \ncombine different API\u2019s with the input from the brand as well  (Chen, 2020) . \n \nEven though their innovation i s exclusively in -house, counting with a team of 150 \ndevelopers, the company relies on  brands \u2019 feedback that are also translated from end -\nconsumers feedback, to improve thei r plat forms or create brand new solutions derived from \nthe demand side . There is a s trong collaboration , between the brands and Perfect Corp. , to \nachieve results  (Chen, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 Big Data  and value generation  \nThe interaction between the users and the platforms provided b y Per fect Corp. generate \nheavy a mounts of data. According to Louis  Chen , the firm  daily processes almost 1 terabyte \nof data , internally managed by a Big Data  CRM  (Chen, 2020) .  \n \nLouis Chen  said that one of key challenge is to get user consent to collect the data  and for \nhow long, since they don\u2019t need the data forever . Heavy encrypti on, protection , anonymity  \nare essential to collect the data generated, reinforcing  that they\u2019re interested in a bulk of data \nand not on individual  requests  (Chen, 2020) . Perfect Corp. holds a Big Data  CRM from \nmultipl e touchpoints, such as mobile devices, from essentially end consumers like millennials \nand gen -z users. This data is analyzed and used to understand consumer behavior, tre nds, \namong others. Brands can also,  use this past data to leverage t heir marketing ca mpaigns, for \ninstance  (Chen, 2020)  \n \n\u2022 AI and its relation with the three major concepts highlighted: technology, \ncollaboration, and Big Data  \nThe technological solutions from Perfect Corp. are AI driven. Their core produ ct, YouCam, \nuses deep -learning algorithms alongside AR technologies to provide an immersive experience \nto the consumer  (Corp., n.d -a, n.d -c). According to Louis  Chen , the YouCam AI solution  is \ntheir hero product, where users can test virt ually their make -up before buying it , both on \ndesktop and on mobile . More than 200 brands are already using this solution to provide \nadvice. According to a statement relea sed by the company  on July 19th, where they launched \n26 \nsolution is integrated on brand s\u2019 e-commerce website, giving them the flexibility to setup, \nmanage and track its results (Corp., 2019b) . \n \nOne of th ose brands is Johnson & Johnson. They announced this year the first -ever AR \nvirtual cont act-lens (Corp., 2020) . This platform is available at TaoBao (e -commerce giant i n \nChina, owned by Alibaba) and WeChat Mini Programs (sub -features that can be e -comme rce \nrelated within WeChat ecosystem \u2013 Chinese messaging app). This is an example that Perfect \nCorp. is exploiting products beyond the traditional cosmetics categories\u2019 and  entering new \nsegments using AR and AI technologies. This brings great advantages lik e a reinforcement \nof brand loyalty and a more complete consumer journey (Corp., 2 020).  \n \nOn the interview , Louis Chen stated  that AI is extremely important  being t he only way to \nbe transformative  not only with  the consumers , but also internally . The leader affirmed that \nthe integration of AI brought operational changes. One of them is  the relationship between \nthe machines and the humans. At Perfect Corp, they have the  philosophy that these \nmechanisms won\u2019t replace h umans, but rather augment their intelligence, by processing \nheavy amounts of information, identify patterns, specific user  needs, among others, with \nthe main goal of making better decisions  (Chen, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 YouCam - platform selected for a deep er analysis  \nAs briefly explained above, their hero product is YouCam, a digital platform where us ers can \nvirtually try -on different products, see on the moment how they would look li ke, and edit \ntheir photos. This idea was  driven by the evolution of the smartphone, where they launch ed \nan app that enhances selfies. There were  many  users downloading the  app and the team \nfound an opportunity to apply these mechanisms on the beauty indust ry. According to them,  \nconsumers want to easily try -out products, new shades in order to enhance their natural \nbeauty and YouCam was a solution to act as a real -time magic  mirror  (Chen, 2020) . On an \nera w here there wa s no evident exploration of these technologies , YouCam  was launched  in \n2014 expanding their services beyond selfies enhancement to e -commerce and retail, \npioneering the wa y on beauty -tech (Industry Global News24, 2019) . Brands and retailers \n27 \n \nThe launch of YouCam opened a door of AI possibilities and opportunities to Perfect Corp .. \nLouis  Chen  affirmed th at projects integrating AI mecha nisms compared to projects that \ndon\u2019t require AI are more effective in terms of perfo rmance, sales, among other indicators \nsuch as Best Consumer review. In terms of value measurement, Louis Chen stated that the \nfuture potential of the technology, or, in ot her words, how much growth it can bring in the \nlong-term is the key indicator of the success of the platform. (Chen, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 A synthesis of the case study  \nPerfect Corp. is a technological company focused on the beauty  industry  that has been \ndisrupting the market on the past years.  They are constantly testing and launching new \nfeatures with key strategic partners with innovative services, covering the demands of the \nmarket.  Their focus on serving their clients\u2019 needs, b oth brands and end-consumers, and the \nconstant technological development are the key factors to succeed on a fast -paced industry \nlike beauty.  \n \nThe input from Louis  Chen  allowed to conclude that  keeping up with the latest digital  trends , \nespecially, softwa re updates , the strong  reliance  on consumer feedback , and the collaboration \namongst p roject managers and all the agents involved,  are extremely important for the \nprocess  of innovation and consequently, for decision -making .   \n \nThe mechanism selected for dee per analysis, YouCam, was one of the first examples of AI \napplied to the beauty marke t, where consumers were able to envision themselves trying -on \nmake -up virtually, wit hout going to the store. It was a success and now, this platform is \navailable for brand s to integrate on their business strategies, scaling its digital presence.  \n \nConcludi ng, for Perfect Corp. , AI is essential to open new doors of possibilities, regarding \ntheir business and on the beauty industry itself.  In terms of effective performance an d other \nindicators, Louis Chen states that projects that integrate AI are worthier th an projects that \ndo no t involve AI.  The leader consider s that integrating AI in their decision -making process \nis a critical topic and it  is part of their core strategy.  \n28 \n\u2022 Background on the company  \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al is considered as a \u201cgiant\u201d  on the beauty industry (Boone, Kurtz, & Berston, 2019) . \nFounded by Eug\u00e8ne Schueller  in 1909 , L\u2019Or\u00e9al o perates on manufacturing and selling \ncosmetics. Headquarted in Clichy, France, the company acts across the world, being one of \nthe leaders  on the industry  (Forbes, 2020) . \n \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al has  five strategic business units : Professional P roducts  Division , Consumer Products  \nDivision , L\u2019Or\u00e9al Luxury  Division , Active Cosmeti cs Division and Travel Retail Division . \nThe Professional Products comprise the following brands: L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionnel Paris, \nRedken, K\u00e9rastase, Matrix and Pureology. This  division  creates  haircare products and handle \nthe relations hip with hairdressers aro und the world. With more than 250 training studios and \n1,5 milion partner hairdressers, this segment has already transformed more than 36000 salons \nthrough their training programs, enhancing the importance of the close collaboratio n \nbetween the haircare pr ofessionals , the brands that operate with them , and the consumers \n(L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -k). The Consumer Prod ucts division off ers a wide range of products using a \nmass market ret ail strategy , making them accessible to all  types of consumers. This segment \ncomprises L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, Garnier, Maybelline, NYX, Dark and Lovely, Niely , among others . \nThese brands covers different categories such as haircare, make up, skin care and are \nessentially sold on supermarkets, drugstores, and th rough online e -commerce platforms \n(L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -c). The L\u2019Or\u00e9al Luxe segment aims to offe r luxury products providing unique \nexperiences. Thi s division has 26 brands such as Lanc\u00f4me, Giorgio Armani Beauty, Ralph \nLauren, among others, where 17 of them are global brands (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -i). The fourth  \ndivision is Active Cosmetics and it is strictly related to dermocosmetic skincare products . \nThis segment work s closely with professionals on the health area being distributed across \npharmacies, drugstores, among others (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -a). Lastly, and considered the \u201c6th \ncontinent\u201d, Travel Retail Division is focused on selling the products mentioned above to \ntravelers that cross airports from all around the wo rld. This di vision aims to exploit the \ncuriosity and the needs of the global consumer s, that want to try the newest releases alongside \ninnovative ways to buy (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -h). \n \n29 \nturnover are China, United States of America, Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and \nUnited Kingdom. In terms of innovation, their R&D centers are mainly focused in Paris wit h \nresea rch hubs in North America, South America and Asia  (Sucena, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 Technology as an enabler to Digita l Transformation  \nThe consumer behavior has been changing  for the past years since  expectations have been \nevolving and information flows fast. To meet the consumer demand, the time to market \nneeds to be short er, constantly adapting to new trends . At L\u2019Or\u00e9al , technological changes \nwere made  so they could stay agile in a fast market , introducing industrial development on \nthe different stages of each process regarding technolog y, product, logistics and \nmanufacturing. The adaptation to Industry 4.0 era had the m ain goal of introducing new  \ndigitized strategies that allowed the company to decrease the time to market.  One example \nwas on the production facilities, where L\u2019Or\u00e9al integ rated intelligent mechanisms  that \ncollaborate with the employees simplifying  the proc esses overall  (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -f).  \n \nJorge  Sucen a, Marketing Director of L\u2019Or\u00e9al , reinforced that, at L\u2019Or\u00e9al , there was an \nawakening on the past decade regarding consumer behavior. The company had to adapt to \nthis new reality, introducing a digital transformation strate gy that have been accelerating on \nthe past 5 years, focusing on 3 main areas: e -commerce, relationship  with the consumer, and \nthe way the company  invests  media (Sucena, 2020) . \n \nIn order t o meet consumer expectations, there are digital technologies that enable the \nrelation ship with them, alongside the creation of products and services. Jorge Sucena \naffirmed that in terms o f the usage and importance to achieve strategic goals, user social \nnetworks are essential for all the brands, where they focus part of their investment on  them . \nAlso, ecommerce  is essential since  it has been accelerating on the past years, and due to the \npandemic they grew on this channel too (Sucena, 2020) . \n \nThe L\u2019Or\u00e9al leader explained t hat hardware applied to the consumer is also part of this \ntransformation, such as 3D Printing that will be relevant both internally, industrial  level, and \nin-stores in the long -term. Jorge Sucena also reinforced that there is an opportunity to skin \n30 \ntheir own data in order to assess the performanc e (Sucena, 2020) . \n \nWhen asked about the most i mportant KPIs, in terms of understanding the values of the \ndigital technologies menti oned above, Jorge  Sucena  says it is th e volume of first -party data \nof the consumer. The leader explained that it  is a way of understanding better the consumers \nand with th e diagnosis provided by the services L\u2019Or\u00e9al has, how it impacts e -commerce \nKPIs such  as conversion rate (Sucena, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 Collaboration and value exchange between different stakeholders  \nAs me ntioned on the literature, the collaboration between different key  stakeholders i s \nessential to be digital ly transformative. This means involving the company, consume rs, and \nsuppliers on their operations and extract the most value out of it  to apply on the innovation \nprocesses.  \n \nJorge  Sucena focused his answers about the innovation pro cesses on the product perspective, \nstating that theirs is developed in -house. However , they rely on some suppliers regarding \nmolecules and sustainable packaging. With the acquisition of ModiFace (explained on the \nsection below about AI), L\u2019Or\u00e9al was able t o integrate their know -how, having the ability to \nimprove some technological processe s and develop beauty -tech solutions  (Sucena, 2020) . \n \nThere  are two product - centered innovation processes  at L\u2019Or\u00e9al . Firstly, t he advanced \ninvestigation  deals with technological platform s to identify future molecules  and, new future \ntechnological platforms . Secondly, t he applied investigation occurs  on a reversed perspective: \nthe internal teams analyze the market needs, and then brief the applied investig ation teams \naccordingly. Then, the y can create new formulas or adapt to existing  ones (Sucena, 2020) . \n \nThe manager  reinforced  that data is a factor that is important across the innovation \nprocess es: primary data, beauty needs, personal preferences  are essential to brief the \ninvestigation teams\u2019  on product  development  (Sucena, 2020) . This means that the usage of \nthese digital platforms and the interaction s among consumers, allows to find opportunities \non the beauty market, or in other words, consumers are indirectl y innovating.   \n31 \nevaluated than sales turnout. The winners receive a  cash award and professional training \nacross the world. The challenge withi n the teams allows them to interact and exploit their \ncreative potential, recommendin g ideas that can be  potential  of value to the company, giving \nthe opportunity to internal employees who\u2019re not directly related to innovation matters to \npitch their ideas (Ariel,  2018) .  \n \nEven though L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s produc t innovation is done in -house, they have a program entitled \n\u201cOpen Innovation program\u201d , dedicated to establis hing connections with be auty-tech start -\nups. The company benefits from ground -breaking innovations and the st art-ups learn with \ntheir expertise to accelerate and scale their business. The program has strategic partnerships \nwith relevant entities such as Station F, the world\u2019s big gest startup campus . The Beauty Tech \nAtelier is established within their facilities, where th e start -ups work  and enjoy the synergies \nwith other tech start -ups. The Founders Factory supports the program as well, where they \nhelp start -ups to accelerate thei r businesses. Lastly, they count on one investment partner , \nPartech Ventures (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -g). \n \nThe Open Innovation program develops two types of initiatives . Beauty Products and \nDevices  Start-ups focuses on growth and learning, where is possible to create cohorts within \ntheir entrepreneurial ecosystem, such as access to Station F and mentoring. Secondly,  the \nprogram promotes the acceleration of digital servic es and tech startups, giving them the \nopportunity to integrate their projects globally at L\u2019Or\u00e9al  (L'Or\u00e9 al, n.d -g). \n \n\u2022 Big Data  and value generation  \nThese technological interactions  between consumers an d brands  create data interchanged \nacross  digital platforms. Consumers are willing to share personal details if  used to create \nvalue for themselves whether in personalized suggestions or  better brand experiences. \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al  capture s, uses and store s data  in order to improve their processes and meet better \nthe consumers\u2019 expectations with more precision, shar ing it int ernally to relevant teams, \nspecially the one in charge of Research & Innova tion (Schiffer, 2020) .  \n \n32 \nwith partners, among others. H owever, this exchange bring s ethical challenges  that the \ncompany overcomes  since the re is a constant need of transparency and protection when \nasking for data  (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -d)  giving them  freedom to opt  out when they want to  (Schiffer, \n2020) . L\u2019Or\u00e9al believ es tha t these factor s are essential to build relationships with consumers, \nemployees,  and partner s (L'Or\u00e9al , n.d-d). \n \nCurrently , L\u2019Or\u00e9al collec ts 1,3 bil lion of different data touch points from consumers (Joseph, \n2020) , proces sing 50 million pieces of data per day (Manufacturer, 2019) . In order to tackle \nthe amount of data created every  day and store 100 years of pro duct development research, \nL\u2019Or\u00e9a l joined forces with Talend , cloud data integration company,  to build a data lake  in a \nprivate IaaS  (Internet as a Service) environment on Microsoft Azure  (infrastructure that use s \ncloud computing) . This data lake is a rep ository that integrates all types  of data sources, \ncombining all databases, and raw data such as images or even roboti cs metrics (Combs, \n2019) . The Research & Innovation team , in partnership with Ta lend, allow s the connect ion \nof all types of data sources from  IoT, marketing, finance on a real -time basis, counting with \nintelligent algorithms that integrates directly the data flows using API\u2019s (Menear, 2019) . \n \nThis data strategy gave L\u2019Or\u00e9al a centralization of all data sources  which also allow to create \nalgor ithms to facilitate the employees involved on these processes such as Data Sci entists  \nand Analysts, helping them on making decisions using high -quality decisions  (Menear, 2019) . \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al created an  environment that harnesses the power of Big Data , using advanced \nanalysis, making them  more agile to create innovative products and respond  better  to \nconsumer demand .  \n \n\u2022 AI and its relation with the three major  concepts highlighted : technology, \ncollaboration, and Big Data  \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al is reinventing beauty using advanced technology to innovate.  The company believe s \nthat science  and technology are  enabler s of efficiency, inclusi vity, and effectiveness. Through \nresearch and innovation, L\u2019Or\u00e9al has two main ambitions: commitment to a more sus tainable \nworld by integrating green strategies using the experience of biologists, biotechnologists on \n33 \n \nThe company ha s been integrating this tech -oriented strategy  for the pa st decade.  Since 2012 , \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al created the Technology Incubator  within the Research and Innovation departm ent, \nan internal start -up aiming to combine the beauty expertise with advanced technological \nsolutions  to keep up with the increased demand of personalized experiences and  products \n(Culliney, 2020) . The company was one of the first to enter the beauty -tech ma rket (Redrup, \n2019) , where they spot a huge opportunity on customization : 52% of young women  from 13 \nand 36 year old would like to have their own beauty p roducts, personalized by themselves  \n(Schiffer, 2020) . The Technology Incubator has a team of physici sts, engineers, data \nscientists, among other specialists and are spread acr oss the wo rld at offices in New York, \nNew Jersey, California, France an d Japan (Incubator, n.d) .  \n \nIn 201 4, they launched the \u201cMakeup Genius\u201d where it used AR to engage with consumers \non trying shades of make up using their mobile devices . Once the consumers find the per fect \nshade, the app gives options to buy the product on that moment.  On these interactions,  \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al can collect multiple data points such as skin tones   (Sheep, 2018) , tastes,  and based \non that asso rtment, the app recommend products that match the consumers\u2019 needs  (Markets, \n2018) . From then, the firm have been launching new techn ologies, at least once a year  \n(Redrup, 2019) . Jorge reinforced that virtual try -ons of make -up strengthen the relationship \nwith the consumer, increasing their conversion. The usage of these solutions, besides \nengaging with the consumer gives powerful information to the company, since the  teams are \ngiven valuable info and can find opportunities in the consumers\u2019 results (Sucena, 2020) . \n \nIn 201 8, the company acquired a tech company for the first time, ModiFace, leader  \nin AR and AI exclusively focused  on the beauty field . This acquisition aims to integrate \nadvanced technology in the L\u2019Or\u00e9al strategy, using the expertise of engineers and scientist s, \nproviding enhanced experiences to the customers such as virtual try -ons, voic e services, and \nnew devices (for example, \u201cPerso\u201d, launched in 2020). The full integr ation of ModiFace  \nwithin L\u2019Or\u00e9al business strategy allowed them to gain an advantage over its competitors  due \nto in -house synergies (Biron, 2018)  and the owner ship of diverse patents  (Carman, 20 18). \nModi face have been  actively  within L\u2019Or\u00e9al  ecosystem such a s retail and advertising partners . \n34 \nenhanced on  his interview the importance of L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2019s digital acceleration strategy with the \nintegration of ModiFace. The innovation processes of the company are no w improved with \ntheir know -how and information that they can extract from their diagnosis tools (Sucena, \n2020) . \n \nIn order to keep up with the speed of the consumer demand and create products that are \nvaluable to them, tech innovation is the solution to answer to this challenge (Culliney, 2020)  \nand L \u2019Or\u00e9al Tech Incubator is in charge of designing new approaches to the c onsumer giving \nthem control on how they personalize their own products  (Joseph, 2020) .  \n \nThe market is fast -paced and grow ing, is full of beauty -tech solutions from brand s like Est\u00e9e \nLauder Companies , Shisei do, among others . L\u2019Or\u00e9al spotted a continuous bet on AI related \nsolutions and increased investments on digital technologies  on other beauty companies and \nmade a bold move  in order to stay relevant in the market (Schiffer, 2020) . \n \nJorge Sucena stated that, in general,  the uge of AI depends o f the job roles and o f the regions \n(if it\u2019s headquarters, regional offices, among others), considering that it  is essential to \ncontinue to integrate AI as a data analysis tool and service provider to the consu mer in the \nfuture, alongside a strong relationship with Big Data . \n \n\u2022 Perso \u2013 device selected for a deep er analysis  \nIn January 2020, L\u00b4\u00d3real  launched Perso, a physical device  that allows the consumer to create \ntheir own product s on demand . The equipment has a n AI mechanism which gets smarter \nover time with the increase of the storage of user data and their personal preference s \n(L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -l). This device will provide even more data than the usual product interactions, \nonce it will record all of the products formulas created by the consum er (Joseph, 2020) .  \n \nThe use of Perso requires the download of an app that will allow the consumer to take a \nphoto and it will auto matically analyze their skin characteristics, such as fine lines , wrinkles, \namon g others . Adding to this, this app p artnered with BreezoMeter,  a firm that gives \ninformation about the air conditions , UV rays, weather, humidity using geo-location data.  \n35 \ndifferentiated L\u2019Or\u00e9al from other beauty companies that use  customization as their strategy . \nFor example, PROVEN  create s custom products through their online platforms  (more \ninformation about their strategy on the sec tion 3.2.3) and delivers them according to their \npersonal tastes and environmental factors. However, it takes time to create the p roduct, ship \nand deliver it, proposition that L\u2019Or\u00e9al wants to change with Perso: ins tant creation of the \nproduct, in under two minutes (Schiffer, 2020) . \n \nThe launch of Perso is set for 2021 and it is expected to be a skincare leader on the offici al \ndebut  from the L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand portfolio  (L'Or\u00e9al, n.d -l). Jorge  Sucena  affirmed that s ince the \ndevice is not in t he market yet, it  is hard to draw some conclusions regarding its performance, \nsales, consumer reviews, or other  valuable  business  KPIs . It is hard as well in terms of project \nmanagement to assess the team performance, time management , among others. However , \nthe leader believes  this is  the future of cosmetics (Sucena, 2020) . \n \n\u2022 A synthesis of the case study  \nL\u2019Or\u00e9a l, as mentioned above, is a giant  amongst all its competitors in terms of technological  \nand product  innovation . Covering different segments of consumers on their 5  strategic \ndivisions, the company acts worldwide targeting efficiently their geographic al operations.  \n \nThe acquisition of ModiFace was a milestone since  L\u2019Or\u00e9al fully integrate  technological  \ninnovation processes on the company in order to be on the beauty -tech frontline. They were \nable to integrate edgy technological expertise and transform ing them in valuable products, \nservices,  and platforms, aiming to meet consumer expectations. Their innovation is \nexclusively in-house;  however,  they have some programs th at allow external experts to share \ntheir ideas and exploit new talents.  \n \nL'Or\u00e9al  recognizes the importance of Big Data  management for the development of  \nnew products and services too and  did a strategic partnership with Talend in order to harness \nits powe r and deliver valuable insights across their value chain.  \n \n36 \nbeauty on deman d. The device is not yet on the market, so there are no proven results of \ntheir perfo rmance. However, for L\u2019Or\u00e9al is the future of cosmetics.  \n \nConcluding, L\u2019 Or\u00e9al and AI technologies are aligned to give the best consumer experience \nand on internal processe s. According to Jorge  Sucena , there is a window of opportunity to \ngrow on AI mechanis ms to support decision -making in the future.  \n \n3.2.3 PROVEN   \n \n\u2022 Background on the company  \nProven is a cosmetics company that develops customized products for each consumer. \nConsidered as the \u201cThe Tesla Of Skincare\u201d (DeAcetis, 2020) , the company was f ounded in \n2016 and launched in 2019 by Ming Zhao  and Amy Yuan , headquartered in San Francisco, \nUnited States  (Crunchbase, n.d -b). The founde rs faced personal skincare issues and the \nsolution to their problems were hard to find. Start ing as a personal mission, the founders , \nwith a ba ckground in business strategy and science  developed \u201cThe Skin Genome Project \u201d \n(PROVEN, n.d) . This project, winner of MIT\u2019s 2018 AI Award , is the largest s kincare \ndatabase  that includes ing redients clinically tested, excluding bad chemicals . Due to the huge \namount of data generated, the founders found an opportunity to analy ze them and find \npatterns between the ingredients and the type of skin of the consume r (Taylor, 2018) . \n \n\u2022 Technology as an enabler to Digital Transformation  \nAt the core of the company was the need to find an effective solution to tackle the difficulty \nof treating the diversity  of skincare. PROVE N is a tech-first company and always had been  \nas it had a strong technological background from the very beginning. The company relies on \nAI mechanisms, such as  ML, to operate  (Taylor, 2018) . This means that the ad aptation for a \nmore digitized environment w as a natural process since  they already implemented a digital \ntransformation approach at its roots . \n \n \n37 \nhow PROVEN  conduct s their process of innovation. However, there are some conclusions  \nwe can draw fr om news, articles,  and other source s such as their website.  \n \nPROVEN, a s mention ed above, has its business roots on AI, ML and Big Data . The  co-\nfounder , Amy  Yuan , created  from  scratch the largest skincare database comprising data \npoints from different sources and the technological requirements behind the business. One \ncan con clude that the process of implementing the innovation was in -house using Amy\u2019s \nexpertise and digital tools, such as ML algorithms to deep dive into the data and find relev ant \npatterns that solve the skincare problems of the consumer . This means that the fo unders did \nnot use an open innovation strategy to put the business in practice.  \n \nHowever, when  entering PROVEN\u2019s website, the consumer  needs to fill out a quiz, where \nit asks for personal preferences , skin conditions and their situation. This means that t hey are \ninputting the data and f eeding the database . When feeding the database, the ML algorith ms \nget smarter over time and improve the recommendations with the supervisio n of the \ndermatologists of the team. One can conclude that t he user is contributing t o the process of \ninnovation indirectly, not being actively involved on it.  \n \n\u2022 Big Data  and value generation  \nPROVEN started its business with a strong foundation on a Big Dat a strategy, created by \nAmy Yuan , CTO and co -founder. She created t he largest skincare  database, \u201cThe Skin \nGenome Project\u201d. It comprises over 8 million reviews, the effectiveness o f more than 20 000 \ningredients , and meteorologic al data where the consumer li ves, among other relevant data \nsources  such as information of 100  000 products and ac ademic publications  (M. Zhao, n.d) .  \n \n\u2022 AI and  its relation with the three major concepts hig hlighted: technology, \ncollaboration, and Big Data  \nPROVEN, as referred to  above, has an AI technology combined with an efficient ML \ncapability . In addi tion, the company par tnered  with a skincare expert , considering the analysis \nof the data on the \u201c Skin Geno me Project\u201d  for the consumers  to create unique solutions . The \nwebsite has a quiz entitled \u201c PROVEN\u2019s Skin Assessment \u201d, where the consumers select their \n38 \nthrough their database and  determine which are the ingredients that are addressing the \nindividual skincare conce rns of each consumer  creating a unique formula for the consumer.  \nThe consumer s are then faced with a regimen  highly personalized to their skincare issues and \nthey can maxi mize their time when searching fo r products, giving them the control,  and \nreducing th e uncertainty . \n \n\u2022 A synthesis of the case study  \nPROVEN is a company that creates customized products using the largest skincare database, \nthe skin type of the consumer and p ersonal preferences, proposing a 3-product  regimen  to \nthe consumer. By answering a qu estionnaire, the company is able to effectivel y personalize \nthe beauty routine of the consumers. This brings great advantages once consumers do not  \nspend their time trying  out the perfect formula for them.  \n \nThe company has at its core a strong ML and Big D ata structure that enables them to provide \nthe best solutions alongside the expertise of dermatologists who contribute to create and \nanalyze proposed patterns. On e can con clude that their innovation process is closed. \nNevertheless, the consumer is indirect ly being part through the share of data and pe rsonal \npreferences, improving the ML algorithm.  \n  \n39 \nThis dissertation aimed to answer the research question \u201cHow is AI impacting the beauty industry \non making data -decisions?\u201d . By analyzing  the topics in depth through a thorough literature \nreview, and analyzing in as much detail as possible three  different and complementary case \nstudies, this research contributes to the scarce literature available by providing  new insights \nabout the impact of AI o n beauty compan ies. Furthermore, an original conceptual \nframework was created to map and clarify the relationship between Collaboration, Big Data  \nand Technology to explain  the digital transformation o f the sector and the emergence of AI.  \n \nThe beauty indust ry has been evolving throughout the past decade essentially due to the \nintegration of new technologies and the change on consumer shopping behavior. Beauty \ncompanies have been integrating digital transformation on their business models to create \nthe best s hopping expe rience, so they can meet consumers\u2019  expectations and fulfill their \nneeds. Furthermore, this digital transformation has also the main goal of changing internall y \nthe processes, generating  more efficiency  and creating  more  value along the value c hain.  \n \nAI has been entering this industry, providing new ways of engaging with the consumer, \nbringing efficiency and tailored solutions to the beauty client. Both online a nd offline, the \ncompanies have been integrating advanced technologies to stay competi tive in the market \nand find opportunities to improve their shopping experiences, expecting results not only in \nsales but also in processes efficiency.  \n \nThe world is facing  a pandemic during the past months and it has impact ed all the sectors. \nThe beauty ma rket is no e xception and the reality the beauty consumer was used to have \nnow changed. Due to health concerns, the consumer cannot try the products offline. Despite \nbeing a world crisis , is now an opportunity for beauty brands to increase their investment on \ndigital s olutions to fill in this gap. All the related AI mechanisms can offer clear advantages \non this domain, exploring new ecommerce solutions  and online  engaging experiences.  \n \nThe Coronavirus pandemic also affected the way this research was conduct ed as it mad e \ndifficult to contact managers and to obtain their answers to the questionnaire underpinning  \nthis research. Even with this considerable and unexpected difficu lty, this d issertation bases \n40 \n \nThis extensive research  made possible to  draw some conclusions  intrinsically related to th e \noriginal proposed framework : \n \n\u2022 Technology is indeed an enabler to digital transforma tion \u2013 The beauty \ncompanies are directly affected by how the technological software and hardware  \nevolves and  need to stay on top of all the tre nds in order to stay relevan t and be \ncompetitive in the market. Especially  for firms that provide beauty -tech sol utions \nsuch as Perfect Corp. , their business is impacted by all the latest tech features  - given \nthat th ey need to be particularly agile, implying always improving their  KPIs on \nprecision and speed.  \n \n\u2022 Collaboration is essential to  interchang e and increase value  \u2013 The innovation \nprocess  towards digital transformation demands the interconnectivity of all agents \ninvolved. On one side, the partic ipation of the users  is being inc reasingly more \nimportant since they are now more informed, and their expectations ar e higher. The \nbrands need to communicate and be transparent asking actively for feedback, \nexample of L\u2019Or\u00e9al and PROVEN. On the other side,  beauty brands and beauty -\ntech co mpanies need to fully exploit the value of their usage to create custom \nproducts that meet th ose expectations and deliver engaging experiences to them . \n \n\u2022 Big Data  management is essential and a critical factor to the technologies \u2019 \nsuccess  \u2013 Data capture and storage is nowadays critical  to all companies on the \nbeauty industry. The management  of the consumers\u2019 data using advanced \ntechnologies enables the companies to understand consumer behavior, their \npreferences, affecting their demand and supply. Some compan ies rely on strategic \npartnerships to deal with this data like L\u2019Or\u00e9al to fully expl ore their expertise and \nefficiently manage their data. PROVEN is another prov en example of the power of \nharnessing Big Data  on providing personalized products without needi ng the direct \nintervention of other parties, maximizing the time  of the consumers . However, there \n41 \n \n\u2022 AI is the biggest window of op portunity to the beauty industry  \u2013 The three  key \nconcepts highlighted above serve a s the foundation to explain the importance of \nsolutions like AI to fully exploit the digital transformation beauty companies face \ntoday. Some of them are already applying A I but, right now, is the time to scale and \ndrive innovation on the sector, amidst th is pandemic. Offline virtual experiences \nprovided by beauty tech supplier s (YouCam from Perfect Corp.), devices that \nproduce beauty products on demand (Perso from L\u2019Or\u00e9al) and creation of \npersonalized products (PROVEN) are examples that the industry is par t of the digital \ntransformation.  \n \nConcluding, AI offers multiple advantag es and there is still an opportunity to grow.  \nCompanies are relying on these mechanisms to make dec isions based on data, to give the \nbest experience to the consumer, introducing new w ays of engaging virtually.  The decision -\nmaking process overall depends on  the type of the companies. Beauty -tech suppliers like \nPerfect Corp., are extremely influenced by A I to take corporate decisions. However, beauty \ncompanies like L\u2019Or\u00e9al are influenced  but expected to be even more in the future. This \nmeans that AI is not fu lly explored and used on the beauty product side, contrarily to \ntechnological companies.  \n \nDespite t hese contributions to the scarce available literature, there are lim itations of this \nresearch. It is an emergent topic which is constantly changing due to market oscillations \nregarding consumer needs and technological evolvement, making all the analyses te ntative \nand at best speculative. Moreover, as there are no statistic al and qualitative databases that \nwould enable a better analysis of the proposed research question, we were circumscribed to \nthe information given by few interviews and secondary sources. For that reason, we are \nconscious that the results of this research,  albeit making a tangible contribution, should not \nbe taken as fully generalizable for the whole of the beauty industry . \n \nThis research p oints  to prom ising additional research ave nues. Further questions for research \ncould be , for instance : the beauty on demand devices ( such as Perso) will be cost -effective \nto the consumer? Will beauty companies base their decision -making only on AI  outputs? \n42 \n  \n43 \n24, I. G. N. (2019, 2020 June). Beauty tech companies are worth more than the beauty \ncompanies themselves!

With the highest potential for AI and analytics among all \nindustries, the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) sectors are poised \nto harness the power of AI to enhance operational efficiency, elevate customer \nexperiences, and drive growth. \nTo gain deeper insights into the current state of AI in retail, a survey was \nconducted from June to September 2023, gathering responses from over 400 \nprofessionals. The goal was to assess the industry\u2019s attitude toward adopting \nthese technologies, quantify their impact and investments, and identify \nopportunities and challenges faced by early adopters.\nThe survey explores views on:\n >Overall AI usage in retail, and it found AI has a positive impact on revenue and \noperating costs. Top use cases highlight industry trends and concerns like store \nanalytics, personalized recommendations, and loss prevention.\n >Generative AI, and it revealed that nearly 50 percent of retail respondents \nbelieve it will be a differentiator in the market, revolutionizing customer \nexperiences and marketing and content generation.\n >Omnichannel AI, and it highlighted ecommerce as the most-used channel, as \nwell as the channel with the biggest opportunity for AI to drive revenue growth.\nThe survey also discovered a unanimous belief in the disruptive power of AI, \nwith respondents representing a mix of retail segments and various business \nfunctions. However, it also highlighted how the industry is still in its early stages \nof adoption, facing challenges such as a lack of knowledge, robust technological \ninfrastructure, and access to AI expertise. While AI investment levels were found \nto be relatively low compared to industry capital expenditures, retailers are \ncommitted to increasing AI infrastructure investments in the next 18 months.\nLet\u2019s take a deeper dive into these key trends, and explore how they\u2019ll shape the \nAI strategies of retail companies in the upcoming year.Table of Contents\nPart I: AI in Retail \nKey Insights on AI in Retail\nAI Adoption Advances, With Industry Leaders at the Helm\nKey Use Cases Forecast an Emerging Generative AI Trend\nAI\u2019s Positive Impact on Revenue, Operating Costs, and Operational Efficiencies\nInvestment in AI Is Low Compared to Industry Capex \nRetailers Plan to Invest More in AI Infrastructure\nTop Challenges Include Inadequate Technology and a Lack of AI Talent\nRetailers Prefer Partnerships When Implementing AI \nPart II: Generative AI\nKey Insights on Generative AI in Retail\nRetailers Are Embracing Generative AI at Different Paces\nWhat Are Generative AI\u2019s Biggest Opportunities?\nRetailers Prioritize Personalization With Generative AI Investments\nData Privacy Tops Concerns About Generative AI\nRetailers Are Interested but Cautious About Generative AI\nPart III: Omnichannel AI\nKey Insights on Omnichannel Strategy in Retail\nEcommerce is the Top Omnichannel Choice, Revealing Future Revenue \nPotential\nPart IV: Looking Forward4\n10\n16\n \n18\nAI is revolutionizing the way businesses operate and interact with customers, \nfrom inventory management and supply chain optimization to personalized \nrecommendations and virtual assistants.

Of \nthese benefits, 57 percent of C-suite executives cited the importance of decision-\nmaking, making it the most popular benefit among that demographic.How has AI impacted your \nannual revenue?\n69% \nSaw  \nrevenue \nincrease\nHow has AI impacted your \nannual operating costs?\n72% \nSaw  \ncosts \ndecrease\n\nA recent study by NYU Stern found that retailers have varying capital \nexpenditures, ranging from $6 billion for grocery and food to $68 billion \nfor online retail. Considering these numbers, AI investment levels seem \nrelatively low. Among all retailers, 68 percent invested less than $5 million \nin AI infrastructure this year, while only 12 percent invested more than $50 \nmillion. Among retailers with annual revenues exceeding $500 million, however, \nresults are more favorable. While 47 percent invested less than $5 million in AI \ninfrastructure this year, another 27 percent invested more than $50 million. \nLess than $5M\n$5 \u2013 15M\n$31 \u2013 50M\n$51 \u2013 100M\n$251 \u2013 500M68% \nLess than \n$5MHow much did your company spend on AI infrastructure?\nDespite  retailers\u2019 optimism on the numerous benefits of AI, the survey\u2019s \nresults indicate they\u2019re cautious to invest. Indeed, 50 percent of those who \naren\u2019t using AI and 24 percent of those who are using AI cited lack of budget \nas a key AI challenge. \nRetailers Plan to Invest More in AI Infrastructure\nFindings indicate that 64 percent of retailers intend to expand their AI \ninfrastructure investments in the upcoming 18 months. Among these retailers, \none-third, or 34 percent, are planning to increase investments by more than 15 \npercent, reflecting a strong commitment to AI.\nWhat are your investment plans for AI infrastructure next year?\n64% \nPlan to \nincrease \ninvestmentResults were aligned among retailers \nwith annual revenue of more $500 \nmillion, with 64 percent intending \nto expand their AI infrastructure \ninvestments in the upcoming 18 \nmonths and 34 percent planning an \nincrease of more than 15 percent.\nTop Challenges Include Inadequate Technology and a \nLack of AI Talent\nWhile there are many benefits to implementing AI, it can also come with \nchallenges. Beyond financing AI infrastructure, retailers who adopted AI shared \ntheir three primary challenges: inadequate technology, recruiting and retaining AI \nexperts and data scientists, and having sufficient data for best accuracy.\nInadequate technology highlights the importance of having the right \ninfrastructure for AI transformation. Outdated or insufficient technology can \nprevent the seamless integration and scalability of AI systems, limiting retailers \nfrom fully realizing AI\u2019s benefits.\nRecruiting and retaining AI experts and data scientists are also significant \nchallenges due to the competitive demand for their specialized skills. Having \ntheir continued support is critical for driving AI initiatives, innovation, and system \nmaintenance. This challenge was identified as the primary reason why some \nretailers chose not to adopt AI, further underscoring the problem.\nFinally, having access to an adequate volume of high-quality data is essential. \nFragmented data, siloed throughout the enterprise, is a fundamental challenge to \nleveraging AI for critical initiatives such as demand forecasting\u2014the top use case \nfor supply chain efficiency. Insufficient or low-quality data can lead to suboptimal \nmodel training, resulting in inadequate performance and insights.\nRetailers Prefer Partnerships When Implementing AI \nRetailers want to strike a balance between internal control and external expertise \nwhen implementing AI. Results show that 52 percent of all retailers opt for a \nhybrid approach. Results are even more pronounced among retailers with annual \nrevenues exceeding $500 million, with a remarkable 63 percent leaning toward a \nhybrid approach. This strong inclination to partner can help mitigate some of the \nkey challenges of implementing AI , including a lack of AI experts, working with \ninadequate technology, and budget constraints.\nMost Retailers Prefer a Hybrid Approach to AI Implementation\n52%63%\nGenerative AI is a subclass of AI that uses neural networks and machine \nlearning algorithms to generate creative and contextually relevant content like \ntext, images, video, and 3D assets. This technology can be used to address \nnumerous needs across the retail enterprise. Popular examples include \nshopping advisors that provide personalized product recommendations to \ncustomers, dynamically generated product descriptions for ecommerce, \nimagery and video creation for marketing and advertising, and even code \ngeneration to optimize developer productivity. According to one McKinsey \nstudy, this generative AI opportunity represents a potential impact of $400\u2013660 \nbillion a year to the retail and CPG industries.\nLet\u2019s look at how retail companies are approaching the adoption of generative AI.\nKey Insights on Generative AI in Retail\nOpportunities and Challenges\n1.\tNearly 50 percent of retail respondents believe generative AI is strategic \nand will be a differentiator in the market.\n2.\tTransforming customer experiences is the biggest opportunity.\n3.\tData privacy is the biggest concern.\nInvestments in Generative AI\n4.\tInvestment levels in generative AI are small in comparison to industry capex.\n5.\tRetailers are being conservative with investment levels in generative AI. \nPlanned investments are smaller than planned investments in AI.\nImplementation Approaches\n6.\tOver 20 percent of retail respondents plan to use generative AI through \nsoftware vendors that are creating solutions.\nRetailers Are Embracing Generative AI at Different Paces\nThe survey\u2019s results indicate a mixed sentiment within the retail industry \nregarding the adoption of generative AI.\nA significant proportion of retailers, 46 percent, see generative AI as a \nstrategic tool that can differentiate them in the market.

Retailers must prioritize stringent data protection \nmeasures to safeguard sensitive information and maintain consumer trust.Personalized Recommendations \nOne Salesforce study found \nthat 92 percent of retailers are \nincreasing their investments \nin generative AI to enhance \nshopping experiences, particularly \nthrough hyperpersonalization and \nrecommendations. This survey\u2019s \nresults reaffirm this trend, with 66 \npercent of respondents choosing \npersonalized recommendations as \nthe top use case. Other leading use \ncases, such as product onboarding, \npersonalized marketing and \nadvertising, and predictive analytics, \nsupport the overarching objective \nof providing consumers with \nhyperpersonalized experiences.\nMarketing Content Generation \nUsing generative AI to create new \ncontent (text, images, audio, video) \nfor marketing initiatives can save \nbusinesses considerable time and \nresources while ensuring consistency \nand quality. With generative AI, \nmarketers can deliver tailored \nexperiences to their target audiences \nmore effectively, enhancing \nengagement and brand visibility to \ndrive better conversion rates.\nMultilingual Chatbots for \nCustomer Service and Branded \nVirtual Assistant for Customers \nIn an industry known for labor \nshortages, these results show \nretail\u2019s continued commitment to \nbettering the customer service \nexperience. Generative AI\u2019s ability \nto understand and mimic human \nlanguage and behavior allows \nvirtual assistants such as shopping \nadvisors to seamlessly interact with \ncustomers to address their needs.\nProduct Development \nWhile this application was ranked \nlower, a striking 83 percent of C-suite \nexecutives expressed interest. It can \nlet retailers create innovative, data-\ninformed, and market-ready products \nmore efficiently, reducing costs, \ndevelopment time, and material waste.Interestingly, the survey results reveal that job displacement ranks as the lowest \nconcern among retailers, garnering only 7 percent of the votes. This finding \nunderscores retailers\u2019 growing belief that generative AI will complement, rather \nthan replace, human workers. It also emphasizes the industry\u2019s need to focus on \nreskilling and upskilling employees to harness the full potential of generative AI \nwhile nurturing a harmonious collaboration between humans and AI technologies.\nRetailers Are Interested but Cautious About Generative AI\nFindings show that 98 percent of respondents plan to invest in generative \nAI infrastructure in the next 18 months. However, they\u2019re exercising caution, \nwith 77 percent indicating an investment of less than $5 million. This cautious \napproach is consistent among retailers with annual revenues of over $500 \nmillion\u201478 percent reported a similar investment range. \nWhen analyzing spending over $5 million in the next 18 months, 44 percent \nboast annual revenues exceeding $1 billion, while another 44 percent operate \nwith annual revenues below $100 million. This suggests that a significant \nportion of both large and smaller retailers recognize the importance of \ngenerative AI, with some smaller players demonstrating a remarkable financial \ncommitment to its adoption. While respondents within this group came \nfrom diverse industry segments, one that was especially represented was \nsupermarkets and other grocers, constituting over 40 percent of the group. \nIt underscores this segment\u2019s ongoing effort to leverage technological \ninnovation to establish a competitive edge, align with evolving consumer \npreferences, and safeguard narrow profit margins.\nLess than $5M: 77%              $5 \u2013 15M: 9%              $16 \u2013 30M: 5%\n$31 \u2013 50M: 5%                  $51 \u2013 100M: 2%                  $0: 3%\nAmong those planning to spend over $5 million on generative AI, the top two \nopportunities are in personalized marketing and advertising and personalized \nrecommendations, each garnering 78 percent of votes. This aligns with their belief \nthat the top area generative AI will transform is customer experiences, with 89 \npercent of votes. These generative AI investments also support their AI initiatives, \nwhere their main focuses include personalized customer recommendations, \nadaptive advertising, promotions and pricing, and conversational AI. \n77% \nLess than \n$5MHow much do you plan to invest in generative AI?\n98% \nYes\n\nA robust omnichannel strategy is crucial to remaining competitive in today\u2019s \nretail landscape. Consumers seamlessly navigate between numerous online \nand offline channels, and retailers must meet them at every touchpoint. \nConsumers expect retailers to provide consistent, personalized experiences \nacross various platforms, which if done well, fosters customer loyalty and \nsatisfaction. Leveraging AI is key in this strategy, as it enables retailers \nto collect and analyze data from multiple channels in real time and offers \ninsights that can inform, for example, personalized marketing and inventory \nmanagement. By doing so, retailers can maximize the effectiveness of their \nomnichannel approach, ultimately driving growth and staying competitive in a \nhighly dynamic market.\nLet\u2019s explore how retailers are strategizing their omnichannel approaches, \nincluding their current priorities and areas of opportunity.\nKey Insights on Omnichannel Strategy in Retail\nOpportunities and Challenges\n1.\tEcommerce is the most used channel.\n2.\tOver 50 percent of retail respondents are using mobile applications to \nconverge the digital and physical shopping experiences.\n3.\tRetail\u2019s metaverse application shifted from consumer engagement to \noperational efficiency, but participation remains soft compared to other \nchannels.\nInvestments in AI\n4.\tEcommerce is recognized as the biggest revenue growth opportunity.\n5.\tRetail respondents still consider physical stores to be the second-biggest \nrevenue growth opportunity, providing consumers with convenience and \ndifferentiated shopping experiences.\nEcommerce is Top Omnichannel Choice, Revealing Future \nRevenue Potential\nEcommerce emerged as the top retail channel used among our respondents\u201479 \npercent of all retailers, and 86 percent of those with annual revenues exceeding \n$500 million, actively participate in the channel. Its dominance underscores \nthe substantial shift toward online shopping and reflects changing consumer \npreferences and the ongoing digital transformation.In addition to usage, respondents also believe ecommerce is the channel with \nthe most potential for substantial revenue growth.

This strong positive \ncorrelation between engagement with and the perceived revenue potential of \necommerce emphasizes its importance as the retail industry evolves.\nThese results also explain why retailers are strategically focusing their AI \nand generative AI use cases on personalization\u2014encompassing marketing, \nadvertising, promotions, and product recommendations\u2014and virtual customer \nservice. The end goal is to elevate the customer experience to new heights.Other Notable Top \nChannels\nMobile Applications\nAmong retailers with annual \nrevenues over $500 million, mobile \nwas tied with ecommerce for #1 with \n86 percent participation. This surge \nin popularity can be attributed to \nchanging consumer preferences, \nthe need for a competitive edge, \nand the opportunities for data-\ndriven marketing and enhanced user \nexperiences that apps offer.\nBrick-and-Mortar Stores\nAmong retailers with annual revenues \nover $500 million, participation grew \nto 57 percent versus 46 percent \nacross all respondents. In segments \nwhere customers touch, feel, smell, \nor try products\u2014like grocery, apparel \nand footwear, and home centers and \nimprovement\u2014participation also \nranked higher.\nOther Revenue Growth \nOpportunities\nBrick-and-Mortar Stores\nDespite ranking fourth in \nparticipation, Brick-and-Mortar \nStores still garnered the second-\nmost votes\u201430 percent\u2014among \nall retailers for the channel with the \nbiggest revenue growth opportunity. \nThis highlights physical stores as a \ncritical touchpoint in an omnichannel \nstrategy that complements the \ndigital experience. Stores let \ncustomers interact with products, \nmake in-store pickups, and receive \nin-person assistance, all contributing \nto the channel\u2019s appeal and revenue \npotential. This result explains why, \ndespite the rise in digital shopping, \nphysical stores remain the channel \nwith the most\u2014and most popular\u2014AI \nuse cases for retailers. With intelligent \nstores\u2019 central role in the omnichannel \nexperience, use cases such as store \nanalytics and loss prevention will \ncontinue to be critical investments.\n\nThe AI opportunity for retail and CPG is clear, with the retailers currently \nleveraging AI seeing a measurable growth in revenue and decrease in \noperating costs. However, overall, retailers are still in the early stages, with \nnoticeable interest and optimism about AI\u2019s benefits but varied levels of \nreadiness to invest and implement. Larger retailers, benefitting from financial \nresources and expertise, are at the forefront of AI exploration and adoption, \nwhile others grapple with challenges like a lack of AI expertise or technological \ninfrastructure and budget constraints. To offset these challenges, many \nretailers are turning to third-party software and development partners.\nAI is emerging as a reliable solution to address a range of industry challenges, \nfrom needing to adapt to evolving customer preferences for digital \nconvenience and address labor shortages to advancing sustainability efforts \nand combating shrinkage. Beyond problem solving, AI presents the potential \nfor retailers to transform their business in unprecedented ways, enhancing \noperational efficiency and employee productivity, elevating customer \nengagement, improving data-driven decision-making, and providing the \nopportunity to create a competitive edge.\nAs knowledge and experience with newer technologies such as generative \nAI continue to prove their worth, we can expect their cautious approach to \nsubside, making way for increased adoption and investment in line with what \nthe industry is witnessing with AI and ecommerce. As the digital evolution \nand era of personalized customer experiences gain momentum, so too will AI \ncontinue its pivotal role in shaping the future of retail and CPG.\nReady to Learn More?\nTo

the role of Artificial intelligence in customer segmentation and targeting and explore different \napplications of artificial intelligence  in cosmetics sector. We also discuss the benefits of Artificial Intelligence that \nenables businesses to analy se consumer behaviour, diverse needs and create personalised marketing content to cater the \nneeds of customers . This study  discusses  various AI tools of customer segmentation  and investigates how artificial \nintelligence (AI) is being used by the cosmetic industry . Data was gathered through secondary research methods such \nas books , journals, publications etc. With technology becoming more and more linked with personal care and beauty, \nthis research attempts to analyse  the complex interaction between AI interventions and consumer Perception  and \nbehaviour . Through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, enterprises may examine vast quantities of \nconsumer data and identify trends that facilitate enhanced understanding  of their target audience and the delivery of \npersuasive marketing messages.  \nKeywords : Customer segmentation,  Targeting,  Artificial intelligence, Cosmetics, Consumer behaviour  \n1. INTRODUCTION  \nCustomer segmentation:  \nAccording to Kotler and Armstrong (1999), market segmentation is the process of breaking a market up into discrete \nconsumer groups with varying demands, traits, or behaviours . These groups may need different goods or may react \ndifferently to different combinations of marketing activities. The following segmentation grounds are: psychographic, \nbehavioural , demographic, and geographic. Additional variables that might be employed in segmentation include \nsituational factors (such the occasion of a purchase or u se), as well as consumer preferences for particular product \nattributes. In order to effectively segment a market, each segment must typically be assessed based on a set of criteria, \nincluding rigidity, potential for further development, size, accessibility , reactivity, and whether or not the customers in \nthat segment and the marketing efforts aimed at them align with the goals and resources of the company (i.e., whether \nthe segment is \"actionable\").  \nConsumer segmentation is essential due to scarce  resources and has to concentrate on how to effectively and efficiently \ncater the needs of  consumers. If the nature of group is homogeneous, it helps in taking marketing initiatives in \ncomparable manner.   As a result, businesses may allocate marketing efforts to each category more \neffectively.  Businesses are only encouraged to perform and administer  segmentation strategies  if they have a promising \nnet payback in mind. Therefore, consumer  segmentation plays a crucial role in the formulation of marketing goals.  When \nestablishing those goals, the following are often included (Ansoff, 1957; McDonald & Dunbar, 2004): (a) a review of \npresent consumer segments to determine how products should be manufacture, construct  or marketed; or (b) the \ndiscovery of new segments to target for the making  of new goods or the diversification and expansion  of existing ones. \nEvery customer is different from one another, having distinct requirements, needs, taste s and behaviour. Customer \nsegmentation plays an important role in which lar ge target market is divided into customer groups such as demographics, \nPsychographic, Geographic and behavioural. These consumer segments have common characteristics that helps the \nmarketers in better understanding and customise campaigns that appeal to ce rtain consumer s. Customer segmentation, \nor the grouping of customers based on similar characteristics, is necessary to create custom -made marketing tactics and \nmeet the specific needs of customers. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutioniz ed customer \nsegmentation, enabling target customers more precisely and get more comprehensive understandings. Artificial \nintelligence (AI) makes it possible to speedily analyse massive amounts of data in order to identify emerging trends and \npatterns.  The use of AI to customer segmentation not only improves the customer base  but also increases  opportunities \nmore on specialized promotional activities on them.  With the use of data sets and underlying patterns, AI can construct \nextremely detailed client categories i.e. Behavioural segmentation: The ways in which consumers engage with your \nbrand (frequency, rate, degree  of purchases,  etc.), need -based segmentation: Customers\u2019 needs and problems are \ndifferent from one another.  Greater comprehension of the driving forces and tendencies of the consumer is made possible \nby th e degree of segmentation.  \nComponents of customer segmentation  \nGeographic: Region, country, city, state  \nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, nationality  \nPsychographic: lifestyle, personality, social class, values and Interests  \nBehavioural: Benefits, Occasion, user status, usage rate, loyalty status  \nArtificial Intelligence  \nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems are able to execute activities that usually require human intellect by analysing  large \ndatasets, finding projects  designs and form structures, and making judgments via the use of algorithms and modern \ncomputation. A kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning gives systems the ability to get more efficient on \ntheir own through time. Applications of AI  is being used in wide range of areas  including  healthcare, banking, education, \nand entertainment. AI improves effectiveness, precision, and creativity in a variety of sectors, from voice recognition \nand computation of images to autonomous automobiles and recommendation engines. As society depends more and \nmore on smart tech nology, which raises ethical questions and highlights the need for responsible research and use.  \nConsumer Behaviour  \nConsumer behaviour is the term used to describe the activities and thought processes people go through when they look \nfor, buy, use, and discard goods and services. Businesses must understand  customer behaviour in order to rightly  \npromote their products. Individual  likings , attitudes, and impressions are just a few examples of the factors that greatly \ninfluence what people decide to buy.  Online platforms and innovation have a greater impact on buying habits in the \ncurrent day.  Online networking, digital pla tforms , convenience , affordability  of information have empowered \nconsumers, allowing them to share their experiences  and knowledge  with a global  audience and make better decisions.  \nIn general, companies  must analyse consumer behaviour which helps in constructing  marketing plans  and maintaining \ncustomer s satisfaction level . \n2. METHODOLOGY  \nIn this study , secondary research is the strategy employed to gather data from previously published sources.  For the \npurpose of making the research effective, data was gathered for the use of artificial intelligence  tools  in the cosmetics \nsector  and customer segmentation and targeting  from the Internet, which contains research papers, articles, Journals and \nPublication s etc. \nObjectives:  \n1.

Its goal is to pinpoint the primary trends in \nthe cosmetics industry and investigate in detail ho w these trends can affect marketing tactics in the future. Thorough \nliterature research  was conducted to monitor market narratives, statistical analysis was employed to interpret market \ndynamics and projections, and a comparison approach was employed to de termine the relative importance of each trend. \nExamining the data in more detail revealed that the emphasis on the clarity and openness of product components was a \nkey trend.  It is believed that future marketing methods will be based on brand loyalty, which is supported by moral and \nenvironmentally friendly behaviour.  \nAmeen, N., Tarhini, A., Reppel, A., & Anand, A. (2021).  The purpose of this study is to examine how incorporating \nAI into purchasing might enhance the AI -enabled consumer experience  based on the service quality model and trust -\ncommitment theory.  Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyse  a total of 434 replies. The \nresults show that perceived sacrifice and trust play a crucial role in moderating the relationships between perceived \nconvenience, personalization, and the quality of AI -enabled services. The results also show that relationship  \ncommitment has a major impact on the AI -enabled user experience.  \nMandapuram, M., Gutlapalli, S. S., Reddy, M., & Bodepudi, A. (2020).  The relationship has been  formed between \nmarket segmentation and artificial intelligence (AI) as a result of recent industry advances.
